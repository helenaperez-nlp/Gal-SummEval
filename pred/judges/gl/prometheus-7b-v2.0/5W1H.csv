salamandra-base,"The given summary is lacking important information that is present in the source text. The main details of the Asociación de Pacientes Finisterrae's demands are not mentioned, such as the request for a local to establish a center therapeutic, the issues related to accessibility to oncological treatment, the need for more medical specialists, and the specificity about the lack of resources in the area of the Costa da Morte. Furthermore, the summary does not clearly communicate the context in which these demands were made or the historical perspective of the situation, which is essential to fully understand the issue at hand. Therefore, the response does not cover the important aspects of the original text and fails to provide a comprehensive summary. This is contrary to the score rubric, which requires the maintenance of all important information. Based on the omission of significant details and the absence of context, the summary fails to meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric. So the score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-base,"The summary provides a clear overview of the events following the asassinato of Jimmy. It includes important details like the number of people arrested, their connection to the Frente Atlético, and the investigation's ongoing nature. However, it misses critical information such as the role of some suspects, like the alleged assailants being military or garda civil, as well as the reactions of the public, political parties, and the leaks of information, which would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. This omission of significant details is a significant shortfall, making the summary fall short in providing a complete picture of the situation. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on the maintenance of all important information from the source document, this summary is lacking some critical Ws from the original text. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"When assessing the response, it's evident that it is significantly shorter than the reference answer. The importance of maintaining the 'Ws' (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) from the original text has been overlooked. This is because the response fails to provide adequate details about the Festival International de Cine - ""Cortocircuíto 2021."" It does not provide who will be involved in the festival, such as the director, the main actors, or the new wave of filmmakers like Caroline Poggi and Jonathan Vinel. Moreover, it does not provide the details of the film program, the objectives of the festival, or the locations of the events.

The response also omits the time frame for the festival, which is a critical piece of information. The important interdisciplinary projects that were to take place during the festival, involving artists such as Bandia Ribeira and Ak-zi-å, are also missing from the summary. The response does not mention the different activities that will take place or the decisions that the jury members will make during the festival.

In conclusion, the response does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text. The absence of key details such as the people involved, the film program, and the objectives of the festival, render this summary insufficient. Therefore, the summary does not meet the evaluation criteria of maintaining all important information from the source document.

salamandra-base,"In evaluating the summary, it's evident that the response captures the essence of the original text, presenting information about the new web portal and its benefits to users. It succinctly covers the accessibility to important documents, the downloadable nature of many publications, and the user-friendly interface for publication management. However, the summary falls short of including the important dates related to the initiation and subsequent developments of the Real Academia Galega, which are key elements of the source text. Additionally, it omits the mention of the Public Knowledge Project, which is a significant component of the portal. Therefore, while the response provides a general overview of the new web platform, it does not encapsulate all the relevant Ws from the original text, as defined in the score rubric. The absence of these details means the summary is not as comprehensive as it could be. The feedback is grounded in these omissions and the need to maintain all the important information as per the score rubric.

salamandra-base,"The summary effectively condenses the key elements of the original text, addressing who is affected, what the differences in digital access and usage are, and why these disparities exist in the context of the Spanish state. It also highlights the significant rates of Internet use across different age groups within Galicia. However, the response misses the timing or dates associated with some of the data points, which is a crucial W for understanding the changes over time. Furthermore, it does not fully explore the reasons behind the digital gap, such as differences in rural and urban settings or the impact of older populations. Despite these omissions, the summary manages to convey the main points, albeit with less detail than the reference answer. This aligns with the score rubric's requirements for a summary to be lacking one relevant W. Therefore, the summary provided contains the necessary Ws but lacks some depth and detail that would have fully encapsulated the original text. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"The given response contains all the relevant Ws from the original text. It successfully condenses the critical information about the formation and goals of Galicia Baleira, the presidency of the organization, the action plan for revitalizing rural areas, and the plea for equal treatment of rural areas versus urban ones. This includes the significant points about the need for infrastructure improvements, the role of cooperatives and banks in the rural economy, the introduction of forestry reordering and biomass plantations, and the call for reduced service delivery distances. The response also captures the overarching sentiment of President Jesús Vázquez, that while the issues are known, there is an urgent need for action. 

While the response covers a broad scope, it could have delved a little deeper into certain points, such as the fiscal policies for small businesses, and the specific strategies to encourage more rural dwellers to pursue agricultural or industrial activities. It also misses out on directly mentioning the necessity of higher coverage rates in mobile and internet services, which was a notable issue raised by the platform. Nonetheless, the response manages to convey the essence of the source document, covering all the important aspects and making it comprehensible to the reader. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response adequately maintains all the important information from the source document.

salamandra-base,"Based on the provided summary and the instruction, it's clear that the summary has failed to capture several key aspects of the original text, such as the budget for the project, the attitude of both the Portuguese and Spanish governments, the details of the meeting where the conflicting priorities were discussed, and the specific objections to the project raised by the governments. The summary also misses out on important strategic decisions and plans, such as the rejection of the project by the Spanish government and the pressure they put on the Portuguese government. Additionally, the summary doesn't mention any outcomes or resolutions reached during the meetings or the cumulative consensus that was eventually reached between the two governments. In conclusion, while the summary does touch upon some aspects of the original text, it significantly lacks in conveying the complexity and nuances of the discussion and the parties involved, making it incomplete and therefore falling short of the requirements set by the score rubric.

salamandra-base,"The response presents a condensed version of the original text, but it misses several key details that are critical for a complete understanding of the events. It provides only a general outline of the incident involving Samuel Luiz, and does not mention any specific details such as the time of the crime, the fact that Samuel was an auxiliary nurse, or the significance of the crime as an LGTBfobbic attack. It also omits the range of concentrations planned across different cities and towns, instead focusing only on a few. Furthermore, it lacks the reason behind the protests and does not provide information about the Samuels's last moments or the actions taken by the authorities after the crime. Overall, the response fails to capture the full context and implications of the original text, and thus does not meet the expectations set by the score rubric. Therefore, the response is not as comprehensive as it could be, which leads to a lower score according to the provided rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-base,"This response contains some elements of the original text, but it omits key details, making it less comprehensive. For instance, it does not mention specific states like Georgia, which are crucial to understanding the current political climate. Additionally, it fails to specify the number of electoral votes that are in question. Also, the summary does not address the implications of the different strategies being employed by both parties. The lack of these details in the summary demonstrates a significant deficit in maintaining all important information from the source text. As such, according to the score rubric, which values the complete coverage of all relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how), this summary fails to meet the necessary criteria. Thus, it does not adequately reflect the detailed and nuanced context of the original text. Therefore, it would receive a score of 1 on the provided rubric.

salamandra-base,"The provided response is solely focused on the attendees of the Cluster TIC Capital Network event. It lists the various financial institutions and organizations that were present, which corresponds to the ""who"" aspect of the score rubric. However, it fails to address any other aspects such as ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" or ""why."" This indicates that it does not maintain all important information as outlined in the score rubric. In contrast, the reference response covers the event's purpose, the projects presented, the future direction of the event, and the nature of the financial institutions and organizations present, which collectively encompasses all the important ""Ws."" Therefore, while the response is accurate in terms of the who, it is significantly lacking in other critical aspects. Consequently, the response does not meet the criteria of maintaining all important information from the original text, as specified in the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-base,"The summary, though partially accurate, misses several critical elements of the original text which are vital to fully understand the situation. Firstly, it omits the names of the entities involved in the dispute, which are crucial for establishing the authority and opinions being expressed. Secondly, it neglects to mention the specific figures provided by the CIG and the time frame in which these changes are to take effect, which are essential to gauge the severity of the proposed reductions and the time for potential solutions or negotiations. Additionally, it fails to address the context of the pandemic and how it might influence the decision-making process. Lastly, it does not cover the call to action and the future course of action that was emphasized in the original text. These omissions lead to a summary that lacks depth and fails to capture the full scope of the issue at hand. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which requires the inclusion of all the relevant Ws from the original text, this summary does not meet the criteria for a score of 5.

salamandra-base,"The response provided misses key elements of the original text, specifically the ""where"" and ""why"" aspects. It fails to mention the location of the crime, which was the concello of Vimianzo. Furthermore, the response does not mention the reasons for the violence, namely the agressor's actions and reactions. While it does provide some of the ""who"" and ""what"" details, such as the identity of the agressor and the events that took place, it lacks in-depth coverage of all the Ws from the original text. The summary of the event, the reactions of the community and institutions, and the subsequent calls to action are all missing elements. Therefore, the response falls short of fully encapsulating the necessary details and is therefore deemed insufficient according to the score rubric.

salamandra-base,"The response provided is lacking in important details that are necessary for a complete summary. It does not address the crucial aspects of the source document, such as the specific roles of the mentioned individuals, the reasons behind the incidents, and the type of threats received by the politicians. Furthermore, the statement about the presidenta's fear of being threatened is general and does not reflect the particular situation described in the original text. The summary fails to mention the type of weaponry involved, the agencies that were responsible for detecting and addressing the incidents, and the fact that these threats are still being investigated by authorities. The lack of specific details and omission of important Ws from the original text significantly reduce the quality and accuracy of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, this response would be rated as a 1 due to its failure to maintain all important information from the source document. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-base,"This response provides a simplified summary of the given text, but it omits some critical information. It does not address who was involved in the aggression, nor does it specify the location where the incident took place. It also fails to detail the legal and social reasons behind the agitation in favor of Porto Cabral. Furthermore, it does not mention the specific actions that the individuals involved in the aggression took, such as the detailed description of how they attempted to assemble sinatures or how they intimidated the victims. In addition, the response does not provide any insights into the larger political and economic context of the issue at hand, which is crucial for understanding the motivations behind the events described. Overall, while the summary includes some important details, it lacks several significant elements present in the original text. Consequently, it does not fully meet the criteria set out in the score rubric.

salamandra-base,"The response encapsulates the significant aspects of Ana Peleteiro's triumph at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It acknowledges the historical significance of Peleteiro's achievement for Galicia, her position as the first individual event podium winner for a Galician, and her accomplishment of achieving a personal best in competition. However, it fails to mention important details such as the third-place finish, the only Spanish record in the event, the number of attempts before achieving the best score, and the specific day when the best score was achieved. These omissions result in a summary that, while accurate, does not fully convey the depth of Peleteiro's success and the exceptional nature of her performance. 

In conclusion, while the response maintains the essence of Peleteiro's achievement, it falls short of presenting a complete picture due to the absence of several key elements from the original text. Therefore, the summary lacks several relevant Ws, such as the specific result, the context of the performance, and the significance of the score in relation to previous and future records. This leads to a summary that, while largely informative, lacks the comprehensive detail found in the reference response.

salamandra-5w1h,"The response captures the essence of the original text but falls short in several aspects. Firstly, the when is not clearly mentioned, which leaves the reader without a time frame. Secondly, while the association's demand for a local to establish a therapy center is stated, there's no mention of the specific nature of the therapy center. The response mentions a local to be given to the association but fails to explain why this is important or necessary. It also does not address the association's needs in terms of the number of concellos involved or the particular challenges they face. Lastly, the response ends abruptly, lacking any conclusion or summary of the association's demands and reasons.

Despite these shortcomings, the response does include essential information such as the identity of the association, the actions they have taken, and the context of the Costa da Morte region. It also correctly identifies the nature of the association as one seeking to improve healthcare services for cancer patients. These elements align with the summary's goal of maintaining important information from the original text. However, the omission of key details such as the specific types of services requested and the reasons behind the association's demands leads to an incomplete summary.

Therefore, although the response contains several of the relevant Ws, it lacks sufficient detail and clarity in explaining why these elements are significant. It also misses out on crucial aspects of the original text such as the exact nature of the association's demands and the context of the Costa da Morte region. As such, the response is somewhat incomplete and does not fully satisfy the requirements of the score rubric.

salamandra-5w1h,"This response appropriately employs the 5W1H method for summarizing the given text, touching upon who was involved, the reason behind the involvement, and the resulting actions and outcomes. It effectively encapsulates the context, identifies the key players involved in the violent incident, and outlines the subsequent detentions and charges. The summary is concise and maintains all the important information required for a full understanding of the situation.

It also touches on the 'why' (to revisit art forms from theoretical to visceral) and the 'how' (through a special program) but doesn't go into detail about these aspects. Furthermore, the response does not mention the number of film submissions or the specific names of the directors and artists, which are important details from the original text. Additionally, it fails to elaborate on the different disciplines that will be covered by the festival beyond mentioning the point of encounter with common disciplines. This omission reduces the richness and completeness of the summary compared to the original text. As a result, the response contains only 1-2 Ws from the original text and is therefore lacking in several key aspects of the provided information. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2

Furthermore, it does not articulate the reasoning behind the new initiative (why) or the operational aspects of the new platform (how). Although the response does identify the website address (publicações.academia.gal), it fails to convey the breadth of the available content or its significance to the institution's mission.

However, it does not delve into the 'where' and 'how', which are crucial for a full summary. The geographical location and the method of how the information was gathered and presented are missing. Moreover, the details about the differences between rural and urban areas, the differences in terms of age groups, and the rates of growth and internet usage are omitted. The absence of such vital details results in a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference response. So the overall score is 2.

Moreover, there is no explicit reference to the specific problems in the rural areas, the measures for promoting economic activities, or the concrete steps for improving public services in the rural areas. Additionally, the response fails to mention the specific concerns about the lack of internet connectivity in rural areas, and the potential actions to rectify these issues. The response also omits key points about the representatives' motivations and concerns, as well as the broader political context in which the issues are situated. As a result, the summary is not as comprehensive or detailed as required by the score rubric. Therefore, based on the given rubric, this summary is lacking in several relevant Ws from the original text.

It includes the who (Sergio Vázquez Torrón, Ana Abrunhosa), the what (construction of a new intermodal station in Vigo), the where (Galicia and North of Portugal), the why (different priorities between the two governments) and the when (previsioned dates for the project). However, the how aspect is missing. The how element would typically include details about the manner or process in which the information is presented. Without this detail, the response does not fully encapsulate the entire scope of the source document. This omission results in a less comprehensive summary. Despite this, the response does well in addressing the other four Ws, ensuring that these are accurately represented and detailed in the summary. Hence, while the response is commendable in its coverage of the other four Ws, it falls short of a perfect score due to the absence of the how element.

However, the response lacks the specific detail regarding Samuel Luiz's identity and location of death, which are key pieces of information from the original text. Additionally, it fails to mention the particular events leading up to the murder, such as the encounter with the group of individuals, the exact time the murder occurred, and the reason for the increased security measures in place at the time of the crime.

Additionally, the summary does not adequately describe the significant points of the election process, such as the states that are still in the process of counting votes or the implications of the so-called 'fraudulent electoral process' claims. Furthermore, the conclusion is vague and doesn't tie back to the crucial elements of the original text, particularly in terms of the current standings and the potential outcomes.

salamandra-5w1h,"Based on the score rubric, the summary fails to provide comprehensive coverage of the key aspects outlined in the original text. While the response touches upon the various Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how), it does so in a disjointed manner and lacks the depth and detail present in the source.

In terms of the 'what', it correctly identifies the objectives of the event and the types of proxectos that were selected. However, the explanation of each proxecto is minimal and lacks the specifics that would provide a full understanding. For instance, the software 'Avalingua' and 'Cardi@ngel' are mentioned without detailing their functionalities or potential impact.

Regarding the 'who', the summary correctly names the presenters and their projects, but it doesn't delve into their roles or backgrounds.

In the 'when' and 'where' categories, the response captures the date and location of the event, but it misses out on key details like the format of the event or the reason behind its significance.

The 'why' and 'how' sections of the summary are particularly lacking in depth and relevance. The explanation of the need for the event and the methods used for the selection process are cursory and do not convey a clear understanding of the purpose of the event and the processes involved.

Overall, while the summary does cover the five Ws to some extent, it does so in a way that does not fully represent the information provided in the original text. Consequently, the summary does not meet the criteria for a score of 5, as it does not contain all the relevant Ws from the original text.

The response, although correctly identifying the key elements of the source document, presents these elements in a rather fragmented way, making it difficult to follow the narrative and understand the full scope of the situation. The response fails to maintain all important information from the source document, thereby making the summary less effective. The use of sentences that are too short and overly simplistic also contributes to the lack of clarity and completeness of the summary. The lack of detailed explanation and proper structuring results in a summary that is less informative and engaging for the reader. Hence, the response does not meet the criteria for maintaining all important information, as outlined in the score rubric.

It successfully identifies the key elements such as the individuals involved, the location and time of the incident, and the reactions and actions taken by different entities. However, the summary falls short in not mentioning one relevant W, which is the 'how' of the incident. In the source document, the response includes specific details about how the incident unfolded, such as the exact location of the assault and the sequence of events leading to the crime. This missing piece of information makes the summary slightly less comprehensive compared to the reference response.

salamandra-5w1h,"This response manages to cover the 5W1H method by answering all the questions presented in the original text. The summary succinctly mentions the who (Isabel Díaz Ayuso, the Mossos d' Esquadra, and the forces of security), what (the envelope with bullets), where (Barcelona and Vallecas), when (the last hours of this Tuesday), and why (to prevent it from reaching Madrid, and due to the directed envelope to the Garda Civil). Additionally, the method includes a how (through the measures taken by Correos and the instructions provided), thereby addressing all aspects of the summary. 

However, the response could have been more concise in conveying the events. While it does summarize the essential information, it does so in a way that could be perceived as slightly repetitive. The use of the phrase ""Quen"" could also be streamlined to enhance the flow of the summary. 

In conclusion, while the response does contain all the relevant Ws from the original text, it could benefit from further refinement to ensure it provides a concise and straightforward summary. Therefore, the score is 5, as all relevant Ws were included, but the response could still be improved in terms of conciseness and clarity.

salamandra-5w1h,"The provided response successfully summarizes the incident in question using the 5W1H method. It adequately addresses the 'who' by mentioning the victim, a muller of 35 years, and the aggressors, two men. It also identifies the 'when' as the 31st of October and the 'where' as near the Praza da Independencia. The reason behind the aggression is explained as a desire to sell the land to Porto Cabral, fulfilling the 'why' criterion. Furthermore, the 'how' is addressed through the description of the aggression, including attempts to prevent the victim from entering her own home.

However, the response is lacking one relevant W, namely, 'what', which is essential for summarizing the event. While it mentions the victim and the aggressors, it does not explicitly state the nature of the disagreement that led to the confrontation, such as the reasons behind the recollection of signatures for the Porto Cabral project. Additionally, while it mentions the impacts of the agression on the victim, it does not mention the broader impacts on the community or the environment.

Therefore, although the response does cover most of the key points required by the 5W1H method, it fails to convey all the important information. It is important to include the 'what' in order to provide a complete and accurate summary of the incident. Consequently, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4 because it lacks the 'what' element.

Moreover, it fails to mention the unique achievement of Peleteiro being the first Galician to enter the Tokyo Olympic medals list, and the specific mark she achieved to earn the bronze medal. The lack of these details significantly reduces the comprehensiveness and accuracy of the summary.

However, the summary lacks comprehensive details regarding the 'where', 'why', and 'how' elements. The explanation of the causes leading to the asasinato and the events that ensued are not as fleshed out as they should be. Additionally, the 'where' has been somewhat glossed over with the mere mention of ""Madrid and other localities."" The narrative also misses out on some critical contexts and detailed developments that are necessary to fully understand the situation.

However, it fails to include important details like the exact dates of the festival (1 to 10 of October), the exact names of the premiums (Premio Especial do Xurado and o premio à mellor direção artística), and the specific names of the jury members who will be responsible for the awards. Moreover, it does not clearly specify that there are 39 films in the official section of the festival, nor does it explain the distribution of these films in the two categories. The response does not mention that the Festival was the place to introduce various artistic disciplines, including but not limited to music and escenography. Additionally, it does not mention the venue where the festival will take place.

The information presented in this summary, although accurate, is not as rich or detailed as it could be, and it misses some important Ws that would provide a more complete picture of the issue. Therefore, the score is 3, as the response lacks several relevant Ws.

salamandra-tldr,"This response provides a general overview of the actions taken by Galicia Baleira, a platform established by the Federación de Asociacións de Veciños of Lugo and Ourense. It captures the essence of the platform's work in promoting sustainable development in rural areas, its partnerships with other organizations, and the broader socio-political context. However, the response falls short of comprehensively addressing all of the 'W' elements that would ensure a full understanding of the platform's objectives, actions, and impacts. Key aspects such as the names of the individuals leading the platform, the timeline of their roles, and the specifics of their proposed measures are not sufficiently addressed. The response also omits the names of the other organizations and the type of help these organizations are offering, which are important for a complete understanding of the situation. This lack of detail reduces the overall effectiveness of the response, making it difficult for the reader to fully grasp the nuances of the platform's efforts and intentions. Therefore, the response does not meet the standard set by the score rubric for maintaining all important information from the original text.

salamandra-tldr,"This response effectively conveys the reasons behind the current state of affairs concerning the construction of a high-speed railway line between Vigo and Portugal, emphasizing the differing viewpoints of the Portuguese and Spanish governments. It provides a comprehensive account of the disagreement and the pressures being exerted on both sides, thereby presenting the main Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how) from the original text. It also successfully condenses the complex issues into a succinct summary without losing the essence of the original information. The response gives an accurate representation of the perspectives and priorities of each government, clearly highlighting the fundamental differences in their approaches to the project. This ability to present the main elements of the argument, while maintaining the integrity and detail of the source, makes this response a prime example of a well-crafted summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response demonstrates a complete understanding of the subject matter and meets all the criteria for a score of 5.

salamandra-tldr,"The response provides a concise summary of the incident involving Samuel Luiz. It correctly identifies the victim's age, nationality, occupation, and the location of the attack. However, it fails to address the full scope of the original text by omitting key details such as the fact that Samuel was targeted as a part of a LGBT-related attack and the nature of the events. Additionally, it lacks details about the social movement and its demands, which is crucial to understanding the context of the incident. Therefore, while the response captures some essential elements, it does not fully encapsulate the entirety of the original text's content. It is evident that the response did not maintain all important information (the Ws in 5W1H - who, what, when, where, why, how) from the source document, and thus, falls short of the rubric's requirements. The response should have included the purpose of the vigils, the fact that they were initiated by Avante LGTBI+, and the reasons behind the vigils, which are related to the LGBT-related nature of the attack.

salamandra-tldr,"The summary provided encapsulates the main points of the instruction given, focusing on the current lead of Joe Biden in the US presidential elections, the implications of the latest election results, and the subsequent legal actions by Donald Trump. However, it falls short of including some crucial details which are integral to understanding the complete context. The summary doesn't mention the key turning points of the election, such as Trump's initial resistance in the polls and the way Biden's victory in states like Michigan and Wisconsin played a decisive role in changing the political scenario. It also doesn't highlight the exact number of electoral votes Biden and Trump currently have, which is a significant detail in the context of the US election process. Moreover, it lacks the in-depth explanation of why Trump is questioning the election process and which states are involved in the ongoing legal disputes. Therefore, it only covers a portion of the ""what"" and ""why"" aspects without fully addressing the ""where"", ""when"", ""how"" aspects of the instruction. Given these omissions and the importance of maintaining all relevant information from the source text, the score assigned to the summary is a 4.

salamandra-tldr,"The response captures the main elements of the original text, maintaining some of the important information. However, it fails to include some essential details that were present in the source material. While it correctly identifies the purpose of the Capital Network and mentions the nine selected projects, it does not provide any specific details about each project or their respective sectors, which was a key aspect of the original text. Additionally, it omits the mention of the Proxectos de Base Tecnolóxica (EBTs) and the impact on the Galician ecosystem. Despite these omissions, the response does manage to convey the general context of the meeting and the need for capital investment, which aligns with the overarching theme of the event. It also does a satisfactory job of summarizing the topics and themes discussed during the event. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response falls short of providing a complete picture of the event by failing to address all relevant Ws, but it still conveys a reasonable summary of the event.

salamandra-tldr,"The summary is generally informative and attempts to capture the essence of the criticism presented by the central syndical nationalist CIG. However, it falls short in providing the specifics necessary for a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. For instance, the summary fails to mention the date of the complaint, which is crucial for understanding the timeline of events. Moreover, it does not clearly articulate the balance of unities and teachers implied by the information provided, nor does it adequately describe the justifications provided by the Consellaría. The summary also lacks the sense of urgency and the call for action highlighted in the source document. The absence of these key points results in a summary that, while touching upon the main themes of the original text, fails to fully encapsulate all the relevant Ws. Therefore, in terms of adherence to the 5W1H rubric, the summary is missing several important details. This is why it receives a score of 3.

salamandra-tldr,"The response does provide some information relevant to the given instruction. It mentions the attack by a man on a woman and the fact that the police are trying to find the perpetrator. However, the response is quite lacking in specifics that are essential for the complete understanding of the event. For example, it fails to mention who the man is or the name of the woman who was attacked. Moreover, it doesn't provide any details about the time, location, and the immediate reactions and actions taken by the authorities and the community. It also does not include the potential consequences or the broader societal and political implications that are crucial for the context in which this event has occurred. The absence of key details such as these reduces the effectiveness of the response, making it difficult for readers to fully grasp the gravity and significance of the situation. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response is lacking in several relevant Ws and is not as comprehensive as it should be. 
[RESULT] 2",2
salamandra-tldr,"Upon analyzing the provided response, it is evident that several essential elements from the original text have been omitted. The response does not address who the recipient of the intercepted letters is, which is an important piece of information. Additionally, the lack of mention about the actual location of the event (Madrid) further reduces the quality of the summary. Moreover, the reason behind the event, such as the aim of the attackers, is also not mentioned. Lastly, the specifics regarding the response to the event by the authorities and the individuals involved are not included, resulting in a loss of important details that provide context to the situation. These omissions make the summary incomplete, lacking the necessary depth and context provided in the original text. Consequently, the summary falls short of the required standard of maintaining all important information from the source document. Therefore, based on the score rubric which requires the maintenance of all relevant Ws, this summary would receive a score of 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-tldr,"This response encapsulates the main elements of the story in a succinct manner. It effectively touches upon who was involved in the incident, the reason behind the agression, the location of the events, the aftermath, and the social context. It also mentions the importance of the 60 million support the campaign received, thus hinting at the significant resistance against the development. However, it fails to mention the specific date of the incident and does not directly address the source of the conflict, which is the Porto Cabral project and its implications for the local environment. Additionally, it doesn't explicitly detail the form of intimidation or the exact process of how the aggressors were trying to dissuade the victim from voicing her opinion. Therefore, it misses some of the nuanced details that could add depth to the summary. Based on these observations, the response captures most of the relevant information but could benefit from including more precise details to provide a more complete summary. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"The provided response effectively captures the pertinent information as per the score rubric, covering the essential Ws from the original text. It mentions who participated (Ana Peleteiro), what the event was (triplo salto feminino), and where it occurred (Xogos Olímpicos de Tokio-2020). It also details what happened during the event - Peleteiro attained a new personal record and the bronze medal, demonstrating why and how this was achieved. The statement regarding the new personal record gives insight into the performance of Peleteiro in relation to previous competitions. The mention of Peleteiro's inclusion in the medal count for the atletismo galego is a significant detail, which reflects her achievement in terms of historical significance. 

In addition, the response maintains a concise format, which is fitting for a summary. While the response doesn't explicitly state the comparison with other competitors (e.g., Yulimar Rojas and Patricia Mamona), the information is present in a compact way. Therefore, all the key details from the original text are present in the summary, adhering to the criteria of the score rubric. 

Hence, based on the criteria for maintaining all important information from the original text, the summary is comprehensive and covers all the necessary Ws, which makes the score rubric applicable to this response.

The information regarding the purpose of the association, their demands for a local location for a therapeutic center, and the mention of the deficiency of health services in the Costa da Morte are all accurately presented. However, the summary misses out on some critical details such as the timeframe of the demands from the association, which was a key point in the original text. The statement regarding the availability of medical resources, specifically mentioning the need for a UCI and additional specialties, is another detail that is not explicitly mentioned in the summary. Despite these omissions, the response maintains the overall gist of the original text and is able to convey the primary message effectively. Therefore, while the response does contain all the necessary Ws to summarize the original text, it could have been more comprehensive by including the specifics of the demands for resources, including the critical timeframe and specific medical resources requested.

It includes who was affected (Francisco Javier Romero Taboada), what occurred (a violent malleira and murder), when and where it happened (in Madrid on November 30), and why and how it happened (due to tensions between the Riazor Blues and Ultra Boys). It also touches upon the aftermath, including the societal impact and the ongoing investigation. However, while it mentions the suspects and the groups involved, it falls short in detailing the context in which they are linked, which could have provided additional clarity. Additionally, while it addresses the broader political and social implications, it could have further elaborated on the specific criticisms from the oposition and the response from the club and authorities. Thus, while the summary is comprehensive and relevant, it could benefit from more detail and context. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

It also touches upon the types of art forms involved and the different locations for the event. However, it lacks a few important details such as the date range for the event and the significance of the titles ""programación arriscada"" and ""punto de encontro de todas as artes."" Moreover, it doesn't mention the importance of the Sections Oficial being divided into two categories, which is an important part of the event's structure. These omissions suggest a lack of understanding or a failure to fully convey the complexity and scope of the festival as presented in the source text. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response is not entirely comprehensive as it misses some crucial information.

It mentions the introduction of the new web portal, the availability of over 350 monographies, the inclusion of academic disourses, and the advantages of the new platform for both viewing and downloading documents. The summary also touches upon the use of software from the Public Knowledge Project for academic publishing. Furthermore, the response refers to the overall objective of the initiative, which is to make the RAG's patrimony more accessible. However, the response falls short of discussing the presentation of the new platform and the expectations for increasing the number of available titles, which are mentioned in the original text. Additionally, it does not mention some specific monographies or document types, which were also included in the source material. Despite these omissions, the summary does provide a succinct overview of the main points, making it quite informative and valuable.

It also emphasizes the rapid growth of the Internet usage in Galicia, which contrasts with the stagnant growth in other regions. The response effectively conveys the core points of the text without omitting critical details, aligning well with the 5W1H rubric's requirement for maintaining all important information. It provides a succinct overview while ensuring that the reader can grasp the core findings and implications from the original text. So the overall score is 5.  [RESULT] 5",5

The ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""why"" are also addressed, with the presentation of the reivindications taking place this week in Ourense, and the aim to prevent envelopment and depopulation. The ""how"" is incorporated through a mention of the proposed solutions such as improving infrastructure, enhancing public services, and fostering employment in the rural areas.

Moreover, the summary demonstrates a nuanced understanding of the context by acknowledging the impetus behind the platform's establishment and its relationship to Teruel Existe and the Spain Vaciada movement. The response also appropriately portrays the leadership roles of Jesús Vázquez and Manuel Mosquera in the coming years, as well as the upcoming interactions with political parties and the commitment to address issues without shifting towards party politics.

This comprehensive approach ensures that all the essential information from the source is conveyed, which is the hallmark of a score 5 response according to the score rubric.

gpt5-base,"The response provided a summary that contains most of the essential details from the original text, however, it does not fully capture all the elements outlined by the score rubric. While the summary captures the key actors involved, such as the Spanish Secretary of State, the Portuguese Minister of Cohesion Territorial, and the Spanish Prime Minister, it fails to mention the detailed opposition presented by the Spanish executives and the political discussions that occurred during the cumio. This omission means that some important aspects of the source material are not addressed, such as the specifics of the funding disagreement or the relative prioritization of different infrastructure projects as discussed among the executives and ministers. Additionally, the response does not provide a clear outline of the intentions and motivations behind the different stances taken by the Portuguese government, which was an important element in understanding the full context of the disagreement. It also lacks information on how the Portuguese government sees its role within the Eurocidade project and the exact nature of the disagreements over the priority of certain infrastructure projects. These omissions lead to a summary that, while informative, does not completely reflect the intricacies of the source text as required by the score rubric. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3

It accurately highlights the key details: who (Samuel Luiz), what (LGBTfóbico crime), when (5th of July), where (multiple cities and villages in Galicia), and why (call for denunciation). However, it falls short in mentioning that the investigation is being carried out by the Policía Nacional and does not provide the specific dates and times for the planned concentrations, which were clearly outlined in the source. The omission of these points results in the loss of some crucial information that was present in the original text. Therefore, while the response does a commendable job of summarizing the main points, it does not fully meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric, as it lacks the inclusion of the investigative role of the Policía Nacional and the specifics regarding the planned concentrations.

gpt5-base,"This summary captures the essence of the given instruction with a high degree of accuracy and completeness. It effectively conveys who is leading, what the situation is, where the developments are occurring, and the reasons behind the current state of affairs. Specifically, it identifies the possible path to the presidency for both candidates, and it acknowledges the legal battle that might be forthcoming. However, it falls short of addressing the 'why' aspect—the reasons for the election outcomes and the political tensions. While it provides an overview of the situation and potential outcomes, it doesn't delve into the deeper implications of the ongoing political drama. Therefore, the response is comprehensive in most aspects but slightly incomplete in regards to understanding the motivations and consequences of the ongoing scenario. So the overall score is 4.

gpt5-base,"The summary effectively captures key details about the Clúster TIC Capital Network event, including the objectives of the meeting, the selected proxectos, and the continuation of the investment process. However, it falls short in conveying the comprehensive and nuanced nature of the forum and the specific roles of each proxecto. While it provides the names of the nine proxectos, it does not detail the unique characteristics or potential impacts of these projects, as required by the rubric. It also omits the process through which these projects might be able to achieve their goals with the help of investors. This would have included additional details such as whether these projects are still in the initial development stages or require capital expansion for further development. Therefore, the summary is not fully aligned with the richness of the original text. The importance of providing the 'how' of the proxects, which would have allowed readers to understand the practical applications and benefits of each project, is particularly missing. This lack of depth prevents the summary from scoring higher on the rubric. 

In conclusion, while the summary provides a general overview of the forum and the selected proxectos, it lacks the comprehensive details needed to fully convey the significance and potential of each proxecto. The missing 'how' component, in particular, indicates that there is room for improvement in terms of maintaining all important information from the source document.

Additionally, the response does not specify the exact number of units and posts affected, which is an important piece of information presented in the original text. Furthermore, it does not elaborate on the reaction of the central sindical, nor does it include details about the mobilization and action plans being contemplated by the community. The absence of these details makes the summary less comprehensive than it could be.

Additionally, the response does not provide any details about the subsequent actions and reactions from the community, like the declaration from the alcalde or the specific actions taken by different groups. The summaries of the protests and the reactions of the political parties are also missing. Therefore, while the summary does include some relevant information, it fails to fully convey the gravity of the situation and the comprehensive actions taken by the community. It lacks information about the direct response of the political parties, the detailed measures being taken by the authorities, and the broader community engagement.

Additionally, the summary could have elaborated more on the actions taken by the authorities (how they are responding to the threats). Despite these omissions, the summary remains largely accurate and provides a reasonable overview of the incident.

Furthermore, the discussion about the larger context of the issue, like the ongoing campaign, is only mentioned but not fully explored. The summary's brevity and its omission of certain significant details prevent it from being a comprehensive summary, which would have been more beneficial to the reader. Therefore, while it covers some aspects of the original text, it does not provide a complete picture, missing key details necessary for full understanding. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The summary is somewhat comprehensive, though it could provide more detail about the event, such as the specific ranking or the context of being the first Galician on the Olympic podium. While it captures most of the significant information, it falls short in providing a full narrative, such as the repeated achievement of her personal record or the significance of this event for the Galician athletics. Therefore, while the summary is accurate, it could be enhanced by including more context or details. This makes the summary less comprehensive compared to the reference answer.

Furthermore, it doesn't provide the context for the accusations, such as the prior incidents involving the Riazor Blues or the investigation into the details of the assault. While the summary does include information about the demographic of the detained individuals, it does not convey the complexity of the situation as clearly as it could. The response also falls short in capturing the full depth of the political and social controversies surrounding the event and its aftermath. This results in a summary that, while adequate in terms of the basic details, does not fully encapsulate the nuances and the broader implications of the event.

gpt5-5w1h,"In this summary, the 5W1H method is followed closely, but there are some omissions that make it less comprehensive than it should be. The 'what' has been addressed but lacks detail about the victim's profession and the political party she is married to. In the 'where' category, the location of Vimianzo is mentioned but it misses out on indicating the exact spot of the incident. Similarly, while the summary includes information on 'why', it does not delve into the wider societal implications or the specific political actions that have been taken. In terms of 'how', it correctly mentions the use of helicopters and the initiation of a criminal investigation but does not capture the full spectrum of solidarity and activism that are being demonstrated across different communities and political parties. Despite these shortcomings, the summary still manages to convey the essential elements of the case, including the identity of the perpetrator and the victim, the time and location of the event, and the reactions of both the authorities and the community. It also touches on the legal and political repercussions, including the holding of a special plenary session and the issuing of communiqués of repulsion. Overall, the summary is informative but could benefit from further elaboration on each point to ensure that all important information from the original text is included.

gpt5-5w1h,"The response successfully maintains all the important information from the original text, following the structure of the 5W1H method. It correctly identifies the ""What"" as the envo of two letters with bullets, the ""Who"" as the recipients, Isabel Díaz Ayuso and Carmen Gámez, and also specifies that the author of the letters remains undisclosed. The response accurately states the ""When"" as the occurrence of the event, with the first letter being detected prior to the second. The ""Where"" is well addressed, mentioning both Barcelona and Madrid. The ""Why"" is presented as an act of intimidation, though it fails to specify the exact motivation. Lastly, the ""How"" section describes the method of detection and the status of the investigation. Despite not specifying the exact reason behind the sending of the letters, the response remains comprehensive, providing an overall summary of the source text. So the overall score is 5.

gpt5-5w1h,"This summary successfully addresses all the required Ws in the 5W1H method. The events are presented in a chronological order which is an excellent approach to summarizing such complex information. It highlights the key points: what happened, who was involved, when it occurred, where it took place, why it happened, and how it happened. By including the details of the event, such as the person affected, the date, the location, the reason behind the event, and the actions taken by the individuals involved, it adheres to the instructions given. The summary also encapsulates the broader context of the situation, including the efforts of the organization Porto Cabral, the resistance of the community, and the ultimate actions of the aggressors and law enforcement. Each point is clearly stated and directly answers the corresponding W, making the summary comprehensive and informative. Thus, the summary does not omit any significant details from the original text. Therefore, the score is 5 because the summary fulfills all the criteria set forth in the score rubric.

It includes the necessary 'who' (Ana Peleteiro), 'what' (medalla de bronce), 'when' (Xogos Olímpicos de Toquio), 'where' (Estadio Nacional de Toquio), 'why' (beating her personal record), and 'how' (progressive improvement). This demonstrates that the response maintains all the relevant Ws from the original text. Each of the Ws is integrated into the summary in a way that retains the essence of the text. Therefore, it can be concluded that the response is of high quality and meets all the requirements outlined in the score rubric.

gpt5-tldr,"The response captures the essence of the original document by providing an adequate summary of the issue at hand. It outlines the mission of the Asociación de Pacientes Finisterrae, their demands, and the reason behind them, including the critical care services lacking in the region. However, it falls short in presenting a more comprehensive view of the problem. It misses out on key details such as the specific period during which the association has been petitioning for help, the exact challenges faced by patients and their families, and the extent of the care deficiency, particularly concerning specializations. It also omits the name of the hospital in question and the geographical details that give the situation its urgency and seriousness. These elements are crucial to fully understanding the context and severity of the situation. Therefore, while the response is largely informative, it fails to deliver a complete picture as expected. So the overall score is 4.

gpt5-tldr,"The response provides a concise summary of the events surrounding the asasinato of Jimé. It successfully includes the key details of the incident, including the time frame of the arrests and the main figures involved, namely the Frente Atlético and members of the Ultra Boys. The mention of the actuation of law enforcement and the potential involvement of foreign citizens enhances the depth of the summary. However, the response could have elaborated more on the political and social repercussions of the event and the investigative details, such as the possible involvement of groups from the far right and the nature of the emboscada as alleged by the Riazor Blues. These elements are essential for a comprehensive understanding of the context. Moreover, the explanation of how the investigation is evolving could have been expanded upon. Overall, while the response adequately addresses most aspects of the story, it falls short in offering a complete picture by omitting some nuances. Thus, according to the score rubric which emphasizes the maintenance of all important information, the summary is lacking one relevant W, specifically regarding the broader socio-political implications of the events and the nuanced details of the investigation.

gpt5-tldr,"The response provided a succinct summary of the event. It covered the key details of the festival such as its dates, the focus on interdisciplinary programs, the focus on the relationship between the cinema and other art forms, the emphasis on important figures in the festival, and the inclusion of different locations for the activities. However, the response could have included a more explicit reference to the origin of the festival, which is a crucial detail for understanding the context and significance of the event. The summary also missed the exact details of the different art forms that would be present. Thus, while the summary contained most of the important Ws from the original text, it missed some crucial information, making it slightly less comprehensive than a summary that includes all the relevant Ws.

gpt5-tldr,"The response adequately covers the 'what' and 'where' aspects of the source document. It mentions the new website portal (publications.academia.gal) and what it offers – access to a catalog of more than 350 monographs dating back to 1906, with over 200 of these available for download in PDF format. The response also describes the use of this portal within the context of the Real Academia Galega and its significance.

However, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary, lacking in several crucial Ws from the original text. Key figures such as Víctor F. Freixanes and Henrique Monteagudo, as well as the roles of Nélida Cosme and Juan Montenegro, were not mentioned. Additionally, the importance of the Public Knowledge Project in facilitating access to academic publications worldwide was not touched upon. Furthermore, the significance of the web portal in relation to the enhancement of access to the institution's patrimony was not clearly articulated.

While it does provide a basic understanding of the new website, the response could have benefitted from including more detailed information about the purpose of the portal, the people involved, and the broader impact on academic and public access to the RAG's resources. The omission of these key elements results in a summary that, while not incorrect, is not as thorough or insightful as it could be. 

So the overall score is 3, as the response does capture some of the essential information but misses out on several other vital details from the source.

However, it misses several critical details that were present in the original text. For instance, it does not mention the different factors that contribute to the digital gap, such as the rural-urban divide or the varying usage among different age groups. Furthermore, it does not delve into the specific percentage changes or the implications of the increased usage of the Internet among certain demographic groups. Additionally, it lacks information on how the overall usage and availability of the Internet have changed over time. It also fails to mention the detailed statistics from the source document, such as the specific percentages of Internet use and access in various parts of Galicia. Therefore, the summary does not fully capture the comprehensive analysis provided in the original text. It lacks the depth and specificity that the original text offers. This makes the summary less informative and insightful than it could be.

gpt5-tldr,"The summary is not as comprehensive as it could be, missing out on several key details. While it covers some of the points made in the original text, it omits critical information about who is involved in the plataforma and why they are doing this. Additionally, the summary does not discuss when and where the presentations will take place. Furthermore, there is no mention of the methods or strategies proposed by the plataforma for addressing the issues faced by rural areas. While it touches upon the main themes, such as the importance of economic development and social services, the lack of detail and clarity falls short of a complete representation of the original text. This results in a less informative and less useful summary for someone trying to understand the context of the plataforma's actions. In light of these observations, the summary fails to meet the requirements outlined in the score rubric, as it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text.

gpt5-tldr,"This response adequately captures most of the important aspects related to the subject matter, meeting the requirements of the score rubric. It identifies the main entities involved, namely the Spanish government and the Portuguese government. It also mentions the project in question and outlines the conflicting priorities, touching on the economic considerations, historical discourse, and the political pressure exerted by each party. However, the response could have included more specific details, such as the exact positions of the involved parties or the exact time frame of the incident. Additionally, the response does not mention the exact amount of funding requested for the project, which is a critical piece of information for understanding the scope and feasibility of the proposed project. These missing elements, although not essential, would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the situation. Despite these omissions, the response is coherent and clearly communicates the crux of the conflict between Spain and Portugal over the railway project.

It effectively mentions the victim's identity, the cause of death, and the various concentrations planned by Avante LGTBI+. However, the summary falls short in providing the comprehensive details from the source. Crucial aspects like the exact time and location of the crime, the nature of the violence involved, and the spread of the vigils across different cities in Galicia are missing. While the response does adequately summarize the main points, it doesn't fully meet the criteria of maintaining all important information from the original text.

gpt5-tldr,"The response does maintain several key points from the original text. It correctly mentions the current standings of the candidates, specifically that Biden has moved into the lead with 253 delegates while Trump is at 214. It also notes the critical nature of the results in certain key states and acknowledges the ongoing legal disputes initiated by Trump. However, it fails to address several essential details, such as the time frame (8 AM Galician time), the names of the states mentioned (Pensilvania, Xeorxia, Nevada, Arizona, Carolina do Norte), and the broader implications of the electoral process, including the challenges to achieving 270 delegates and the ongoing debates over electoral fraud. By omitting these details, the response does not provide a complete and nuanced understanding of the situation as presented in the original text. Hence, it falls short in delivering a comprehensive summary. This is why the response gets a score of 4. The crucial omission is the exact nature of the legal disputes which is vital for the understanding of the tense political atmosphere.

gpt5-tldr,"Upon reviewing the provided summary, it is clear that it has successfully incorporated most of the essential Ws from the original source text. The information regarding the name of the event, the location, the date, the parties involved (the proxects and potential investors), and the specifics of each proxect (names, nature of their products or services, the level of funding they require) are adequately represented. However, there is a notable omission in the form of the second-level W, which relates to the goal and impact of the event. This is essential for understanding the purpose behind the organization of the event and the potential benefits it offers to the participants. Thus, while the summary provides a generally comprehensive overview, it falls short of capturing the complete essence of the event, specifically its significance and broader implications. So, in accordance with the score rubric, which places a high premium on maintaining all the relevant Ws from the original text, this absence of one relevant W results in a deduction of points. Hence, the summary is considered to be of quality 4, as it meets the requirements of most important Ws but does not fully encapsulate the event's purpose and impact.

gpt5-tldr,"The response, while summarizing the central issue presented by the CIG, misses critical details found in the original text, specifically regarding the nature of the CIG's denunciation and the details of the numerical impact of the Consellaría's proposed changes. This lack of detail results in the omission of essential information that helps convey the gravity of the situation. In addition, the nuances of the Consellaría's defense are also overlooked, leading to an incomplete summary. While the core elements of the issue are addressed, the absence of specific information about the figures involved, the CIG's analysis of these figures, and the actions suggested by both the CIG and the Consellaría, undermines the response's effectiveness in conveying the full scope of the dispute. Consequently, this response does not meet the standard for a summary that includes all relevant information, as required by the score rubric. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2

However, it does not mention when the incident took place (mércores 15 de maio) or how the situation was addressed beyond the mention of extraordinary sessions by the local council and calls for solidarity by various entities. While these details may seem less critical than others, they are essential for understanding the full context of the event and the subsequent actions taken in response. Additionally, there is no mention of the specific place of the attack (Unións Agrarias) or the name of the attacker's profession. By including these omissions, the summary would provide a more complete picture of the situation. So the summary meets some of the requirements but misses others, resulting in a score of 3 based on the rubric provided.

gpt5-tldr,"The response is adequate, but it lacks some important details that were present in the original text. While it correctly mentions the incident of the intercepted letter with bullets, the detection of the second letter with munition, and the reactions from Ayuso, it fails to address the where and the who, which are crucial in understanding the context of the events. It doesn't specify that these incidents occurred in Barcelona and Vallecas, nor does it mention the agencies involved, such as the Mossos d' Esquadra and the Directorate Xeral da Garda Civil. Furthermore, it doesn't mention the date on which the presidenta received the threatening message, which could be significant for understanding the timing of the events. The mention of Ayuso's quote about ""serenity"" is a notable element, but without further context, it might not fully convey the implications of the events.

gpt5-tldr,"The response provided by the assistant demonstrates a grasp of the essential elements from the original text, though some elements have been slightly altered or omitted. The response mentions the key facts: the agression against Irene, the attempts to prevent her from assembling her household, and the detailed context of the Porto Cabral project. It does, however, miss out on the ""where"" element, specifically the location of the Praza da Independencia, which is a key detail in the original text. This omission slightly detracts from the completeness of the summary. Nevertheless, the response succeeds in maintaining the majority of important information, including the ""who"" (Irene), ""what"" (aggression, sinatures, macrocentro Porto Cabral), ""when"" (the date of the incident), ""why"" (opposition to the project), and ""how"" (the methods of the agressors). The response also includes elements of the ""how"" (the physical actions, the intimidation tactics used, and the involvement of police officers). It is this ability to condense and retain most of the critical details from the source text while omitting some minor elements that places the response in the category of a high-quality summary. Therefore, it can be concluded that the response maintains the majority of relevant Ws, thus meeting the requirements of the score rubric.

However, it fails to mention a few crucial details such as the nature of her victory in the first instance and the importance of the score of 14.87 in relation to her personal best. The absence of these elements results in a less comprehensive summary compared to the original text. Thus, the response meets the requirements of the score rubric to some extent but is not as complete as it could be. Consequently, while the summary is quite accurate, it does not fully capture the breadth of the original content, resulting in it scoring a 4 rather than a 5.

It fails to mention the time frame of the Asociación's existence, the gravity of the region's care needs, and the specifics of the association's demands, such as the UCI requirement and the geographical and transportation difficulties they face. While these omissions do not completely negate the overall understanding, they are significant enough to impact the completeness of the summary. Thus, based on the score rubric, which requires maintaining all important information, this summary falls short.

There's no mention of the events that led up to the crime, the identities of the suspects, the reasons for their arrests, or the findings and conclusions drawn by the investigating authorities.

It also highlights the presence of 39 films, including several estreias, and mentions the interdisciplinary projects and participating artists. However, it misses the important details about the venue and the date when the festival begins, which are vital for someone planning to attend the event. Therefore, while the summary is comprehensive in its coverage of the festival's features, it lacks some pertinent information as per the rubric's criteria for a score of 5.

Therefore, it lacks several relevant Ws which would have provided a more comprehensive summary. 

In terms of maintaining all important information, the response does a poor job, as it omits significant details that were originally included in the text. The omission of key aspects such as the names of prominent figures, the specificity of available materials, and the elaboration on the benefits of the new web, mean that the response is significantly less informative than it could be.

Additionally, it omits information about the specific numbers and percentages that are critical for understanding the extent of the digital divide. For instance, it does not provide any details about the current and past numbers of Internet users or the percentage of houses with internet access in Galicia and the national average.

Furthermore, the response does not delve into the broader context of the disagreement, nor does it mention the significance of the train project as seen from both sides of the debate. As a result, the summary does not fully capture the breadth and depth of the information presented in the original text, missing key elements like the views of the Portuguese government, the pressure exerted by the Spanish government on the Portuguese government, and the specific stances of the various ministers involved.

Additionally, it does not address the possible reasons behind the Consellaría's actions or the direct appeals to the public and the teaching bodies, nor does it discuss the concerns related to the unbalanced student-to-teacher ratio.

For instance, it doesn't mention the tenza ilícita de armas or obxectos perigosos, nor does it detail the backgrounds and associations of some of the individuals, which are crucial to understanding the context of the asasinato. Additionally, it doesn't provide insight into the progression of the investigation or the various points of view regarding the asasinato and its aftermath. Despite these shortcomings, the summary still maintains a significant amount of the crucial information from the original text. So, based on the provided rubric, the summary can be considered adequate, although there's room for improvement to ensure that all important information is represented. Therefore, the summary is close to being a perfect representation of the source document, with minor deficiencies.

llama3-5w1h,"The response contains most of the information presented in the original text. However, it omits a few crucial details, which are key to a comprehensive summary. Specifically, the response fails to mention that the festival began with short films and now includes long films, an important evolution of the festival that was clearly stated in the original text. Moreover, while the response does mention the event's intention to be a ""point of encounter for all arts,"" it does not fully convey the depth of this intent, particularly in terms of interdisciplinary projects and the broader goal of fostering a richer dialogue within the cinematic field. Also, the involvement of artists and professionals such as Anna Henckel-Donnersmarck and Leire Apellaniz is not included, which is significant as it underscores the festival's aim to engage a wide range of industry participants and cultural enthusiasts. Despite these omissions, the response does manage to capture the core aspects of the festival's programming and objectives, as well as key individuals involved. Thus, it meets the requirements of the 5W1H method to a certain degree but is missing some important elements from the original text. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response does cover some of the information from the original text, but it lacks crucial details that were mentioned. The main points that have been included are the location (Galiza), the entity (Real Academia Galega), the timeline (from 1906), and the purpose (to promote access to the institution's patrimony). However, the response is missing several important details such as the specific achievements and publications of the academy, the description of the web portal, the roles of the individuals present at the launch, and the exact nature of the accessibility features. This lack of detail fails to convey the full scope of the announcement and the features of the new web portal, which were both highlighted in the original text. Therefore, although the response touches upon some of the important elements, it does not cover the majority of them, which is necessary for a comprehensive summary according to the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"Upon examination of the response, it is apparent that the summary is insufficient in maintaining all important information from the original text. It merely repeats the notion that there is a reduction in the digital gap in Galicia and it continues to be smaller than the Spanish average, without offering any new or detailed insight into the subject matter. This lack of depth and detail results in the summary containing no relevant W from the original text. 

The summary fails to capture any of the key elements mentioned in the original text, such as the reason for the reduction in the digital gap, specific statistics or percentages, the impact of different demographic factors on the gap, and the contrast between urban and rural areas within Galicia itself. Moreover, it does not offer any unique insights or observations that would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the situation in Galicia. 

It is evident that the summary lacks several relevant Ws that are critical for understanding the original text. In the context of the 5W1H method, the absence of these key elements renders the summary incomplete and ineffective. Therefore, based on the criteria outlined in the score rubric, the summary is lacking several relevant Ws and, as such, does not meet the requirements of a complete summary of the original text. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-5w1h,"The provided response is lacking in several key areas of the summary required by the rubric. It only covers some of the Ws, omitting important elements such as the action plan's aim of frear o descobramento das zonas rurais and the introduction of measures of promotion económica. Additionally, it fails to address the 'how' aspect, which would provide the method or process through which the objectives can be achieved. The lack of comprehensive information and the omission of crucial details results in an incomplete summary. Therefore, this response does not fully satisfy the criteria outlined in the rubric. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided successfully encapsulates the essential information of the original text. It adheres to the 5W1H method by accurately detailing the key elements of the story - the ""what"" (the conexión ferroviaria atlántica), the ""who"" (the Governo español, secretario de Estado de Infraestruturas, and the ministers of Cohesión Territorial and of Infraestruturas), the ""when"" (the time frame of the discussion, specifically in October 2020 and at the Cumio Hispano-Portugués), the ""where"" (the geographical locations involved, such as Lisboa, Vigo, and Madrid), the ""why"" (the reasons behind the opposition to the conexion, such as the cost and prioritization), and the ""how"" (the action plan discussed). 

Moreover, the response maintains the flow of information presented in the original text and keeps all crucial details intact, ensuring that the summary reflects the entirety of the conversation without omission. This makes the summary comprehensive and in complete alignment with the requirements of the score rubric. Hence, considering the content and the structure, the response fulfills the criteria of a high-quality summary by capturing the complete set of relevant Ws from the original text. 
[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided gives an overview of the case in question, touching upon the key points of the original text. It identifies Samuel Luiz as the victim and provides the time and place of the incident, which aligns with the required elements of the 5W1H summary. However, it fails to address the reason for the mobilizations (why), which were aimed at drawing attention to the possible homophobic nature of the crime. Furthermore, while it correctly mentions the investigating body (Policía Nacional), it does not mention any details about the concentrations or the locations they were planned to take place, leaving out significant aspects of the original text.

In conclusion, the response only partially captures the necessary elements from the source text. It is crucial to include all elements of the 5W1H summary to provide a comprehensive overview. Therefore, based on the provided score rubric, which demands a full representation of all the important information from the source, this response does not fulfill the requirements.

llama3-5w1h,"This summary, although containing some elements of the original text, fails to cover all important aspects of the 5W1H method. It only addresses ""who"" and ""why"" without touching upon the ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" and ""how"" elements. It lacks a clear identification of the task, does not specify the time frame, and does not mention the states where the voting process is still ongoing, nor the legal challenges initiated by Trump. This results in a partial understanding of the situation, which is not sufficient for a comprehensive summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary is lacking several important pieces of information from the original text. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-5w1h,"The summary captures the essentials of the original text, covering the 'What', 'Who', 'When', 'Where', 'Why', and 'How'. It gives an accurate account of the Clúster TIC Capital Network's event, the purpose of the foro, and the nature of the projects that were presented. However, the 'Where' is only implied through the mention of Compostela, and the 'How' is not explicitly explained, leaving some aspects of the source text less detailed than they could be. Therefore, while it does an adequate job of summarizing the key points, it falls short of capturing the full depth of the original text. This makes the summary less comprehensive than what is expected according to the rubric. 

So, while it addresses most of the Ws, it fails to provide a clear explanation of the location of the event and the process by which the projects were selected and presented. This is why it doesn't fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, which demands all the relevant Ws to be included. 

However, it is worth noting that this response maintains a high level of relevance and precision in presenting the information. The absence of a complete explanation in the 'Where' and 'How' is not a major oversight but rather a slight deviation from the ideal summary. 

In conclusion, while it is commendable that the response includes the majority of the Ws, it does not provide a comprehensive account as required by the rubric. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 4 because it misses one important W - the 'How' - which details the process by which the proxectos were selected and presented.

llama3-5w1h,"The summary is successful in capturing the core elements of the instruction, addressing the what, who, when, where, why, and how in the 5W1H method. It mentions the criticisms from the community, the role of the CIG in raising the issue, the timing with the upcoming course, the geographical location, the reasoning behind the reduction of personnel, the method of modification to the educational catalogues, and the subsequent implications and actions taken. However, there is a slight shortfall in comprehensiveness. It does not mention the specific numbers (109 unidades, 150 professores) and the immediate impact of these changes, which are significant pieces of information. It also doesn't touch upon the element of the pandemic situation as a catalyst for this issue. Hence, the summary, while being largely informative, lacks some details present in the original text. Nevertheless, it still provides a clear and coherent summary of the situation, indicating that it maintains the majority of important information. Therefore, based on the given score rubric, it would be assigned a score of 4.

llama3-5w1h,"The response appropriately identifies the key figures involved in the incident, such as Javier M. and Montse López, and mentions the type of crime committed - a violation of gender. However, it falls short in providing all the necessary details that make the summary comprehensive. For instance, it doesn't mention the time of the event, the specific place where the attack took place, or the broader societal reaction to the crime. Additionally, the summary misses out on how the event unfolded, such as Javier M. being at the office of Unións Agrarias and Montse López being attacked outside. Furthermore, there's no mention of the political consequences of the incident or the efforts being made to prevent such crimes in the future. These omissions result in the summary lacking the depth and completeness required by the task. Therefore, the response does not fully satisfy the criteria outlined in the score rubric.

llama3-5w1h,"Your summary does a decent job at covering all the Ws (who, what, when, where, why, and how) as required by the score rubric. However, it misses out on some finer details that would enhance the understanding of the text. For instance, the sentence ""Como: Os controis de Correos detectaron as balas en Barcelona antes de que o sobre chegasse a Madrid"" could be improved with the addition of ""e se contiñan algunha mensaxe"", which was stated in the text. This gives a more complete picture of the events that occurred.

Also, the importance of the issue, as emphasized by Isabel Díaz Ayuso, is mentioned but not highlighted as a statement of her. It's also missing the direct quote from Ayuso about the situation. The direct quotes in the summary are important to capture the essence of the original text.

Lastly, it doesn't mention the direct involvement of the press in reporting the incident. The inclusion of this detail would provide a fuller context of the situation and how it unfolded in the public domain.

Considering these points, it's evident that while your summary contains most of the relevant information, it could be further improved to capture the subtleties and finer details present in the original text.

llama3-5w1h,"This response provides a concise summary of the incident, touching upon key elements such as the victim, the timing of the event, the location, and the reasons behind the aggression. However, it falls short in conveying the full context and consequences of the event. For example, it omits details about the reasons behind the legalization of the Porto Cabral macrocentre and the involvement of the local community, which were integral to the narrative. Furthermore, the response fails to mention the intimidation and hostility experienced by other women in the area, which adds depth to the issue at hand. The summary is also lacking in its portrayal of the aftermath of the incident and the future legal actions that may be taken by the victim.

It also lacks the information about the total score of her performance and how this led to her win. The response is succinct, but its brevity results in the omission of vital details. These gaps prevent the summary from fully representing the depth and significance of the source material. Therefore, despite capturing some key elements, the summary's incompleteness renders it insufficient according to the score rubric. It meets the requirements of the 5W1H method, yet the absence of certain Ws from the original text causes it to fall short of a higher score.

It succinctly mentions the purpose of the association, the need for a new facility in Carnota, and the requirement for improved services at the local hospital. However, it falls short in conveying all the relevant Ws, specifically the ""where"" aspect. While the response identifies the association's foundation and its current demands, it omits the essential information regarding the area of operation (Costa da Morte) and its specific characteristics. Additionally, the response does not delve into the broader implications of the association's demands, such as the potential impact on the local healthcare system or the inadequate transportation options for the affected population. This lack of detail concerning the geographical and demographic context is what differentiates the response from a higher score.

Additionally, it doesn't address the role of the club or the city council in failing to prevent the tragedy. Overall, while it provides a condensed overview of the incident, it fails to maintain all the important information, which would include details about the suspects, the actions taken by the authorities, and the broader implications for the team and its fans.

It also neglects to mention the involvement of the president and other key members of the RAG, which provides context to the importance of this new initiative. Furthermore, the response does not address why the portal was created or how it can be used to advance the university's mission, which are crucial pieces of information for understanding the project's relevance.

Additionally, the summary omits the importance of creating a new model for rural development, which includes fostering agricultural and agrarian businesses, offering micro-credit facilities, and enhancing public services in rural areas. The summary also overlooks the importance of sustainable forest management and the use of biomass plants as part of a comprehensive rural development strategy.

These missing pieces of information reduce the response's effectiveness in encapsulating the essential elements of the original text. The response does capture the core theme of uncertainty surrounding the election results, which aligns with one aspect of the original text (what).
