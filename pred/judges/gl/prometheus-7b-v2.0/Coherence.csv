salamandra-base,"The given summary is articulated in a manner that allows the reader to follow the narrative seamlessly. The use of temporal connectors such as ""e despois"" and ""tamén solicitan"" effectively establish a sequence of events, demonstrating an understanding of how ideas are related in a coherent way. Furthermore, the summary provides contextual information to support the various points made, which enhances the overall coherence of the text.

In contrast, the reference answer does not exhibit the same level of coherence. While it does provide a summary of the initial text, the summary lacks the connective phrases that are present in the given response. The absence of temporal or causal linking in the reference answer makes it more difficult to follow the narrative flow, as the ideas appear disjointed.

Additionally, the response incorporates narrative elements such as ""Ademais,"" ""Esta petición,"" and ""Isto permítenos,"" which provide a smoother transition from one point to another. These narrative devices contribute to the overall coherence of the summary by clearly marking the relationship between ideas and sentences.

Considering the score rubric's emphasis on coherence, the absence of explicit coherence in the reference answer leads to a less structured and less organized summary. While there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, the lack of explicit connectors between the sentences causes the summary to lose its cohesiveness.

Based on these observations, the given response better aligns with the score rubric's requirements for explicit coherence, which are reflected in the seamless flow of ideas and the use of textual resources to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. Therefore, the response demonstrates a superior level of coherence when compared to the reference answer. 
[RESULT] 5",5
salamandra-base,"The summary provides a coherent summary of the text, presenting a logical sequence of events related to the asassination of the football player, the implication of certain groups, and the aftermath of the investigation. The text is well-organized, with sentences that build upon one another. The use of temporal markers allows for a smooth transition between events, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary.

While the summary does provide a chronological order of events and the involvement of different parties, it does not explicitly mention key elements like the 36 detentions in the initial operation, the subsequent arrest of 4 members of the Ultra Boys, or the connection to members of the security forces. These omissions reduce the explicit coherence of the summary.

However, the summary does succeed in capturing the essence of the main points of the original text, despite these omissions. The language used is appropriate and conveys the seriousness of the situation. The lack of explicit connectors and discourse markers does not detract significantly from the overall coherence.

In light of the score rubric, the summary displays a moderate degree of coherence, which is slightly lower than what might be expected from a summary that includes all critical aspects of the original text. Despite these shortcomings, the summary remains effective in summarizing the text. Therefore, based on the scoring criteria, the summary merits a score of 4.

salamandra-base,"The provided response lacks the explicit coherence necessary for a high-quality summary. While it mentions several elements from the original text, the connections between the ideas are not clearly articulated. For instance, the response does not explain how the different arts are intertwined with the festival's themes, nor does it adequately connect the various segments of the festival. Moreover, there is no clear progression or narrative arc in the way the information is presented. This lack of coherence, structure, and explicit connections between ideas makes the response less effective as a summary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response falls short of the required level of coherence. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-base,"In evaluating the response, the criteria of coherence were applied, where coherence is determined by the logical progression of ideas and the presence of connectors to link sentences. The response effectively summarizes the main points of the provided text, touching on the various functionalities of the RAG's new web platform, such as the direct access to publications and the various resources that can be found there. However, the response lacks explicit connectors or markers that could have improved the coherence further, such as temporal or causal markers that would have enhanced the flow between sentences. The summary does not simply list events but instead presents a narrative with logical progression of ideas. Despite this, it could benefit from the inclusion of more specific details to further enhance its coherence. So, the response falls into the score 4 category due to its implicit coherence, which can be improved with the use of more explicit textual resources.

salamandra-base,"The summary provided presents a good overview of the issue of digital gap in Galicia. However, it does not display an explicit coherence as required by the score rubric. The response seems to merely present different aspects of the problem without explicitly linking these points. The use of connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the flow of ideas is notably absent. Although the sentences follow a logical sequence, the overall cohesion is compromised due to the lack of explicit connectors. Therefore, based on the given score rubric that emphasizes the importance of explicit coherence, the response is graded as a 4. 

The response does provide a structured summary, but it fails to meet the highest level of coherence as specified in the score rubric. While it manages to convey the necessary information, the omission of explicit textual resources that could clarify the relationship between ideas and sentences is a significant shortcoming. This is why, even though the information is presented in a somewhat coherent manner, the lack of explicit connectors is a major drawback. 

Despite this, the summary does offer a clear, albeit implicit, understanding of the various aspects of the digital gap issue in Galicia. It acknowledges the rural-urban divide and the age-related variations in Internet usage, which contributes to the overall narrative about Galician digital gap. However, the absence of explicit markers that could enhance the flow of ideas is a key issue, which should ideally be addressed in the summary.

Therefore, while the response meets the criteria for a 4, it does fall short of a 5 due to its lack of explicit coherence markers. By incorporating these markers, the response could potentially enhance its coherence and alignment with the rubric's requirement for explicit coherence.

salamandra-base,"The given response presents a coherent narrative, effectively summarizing the key points from the original text. It successfully outlines the purpose and objectives of Galicia Baleira, the series of proposals to tackle the issues of rural depopulation and the importance of political action. The response includes several elements that contribute to its coherence and quality. Firstly, it mentions the core issues of rural depopulation, the need for economic promotion, and the significance of preserving public services. Secondly, it discusses the concrete actions that Galicia Baleira intends to take, such as the development of infrastructure, the implementation of renewable energy sources, and the creation of new jobs in rural areas. Furthermore, it includes a call to action for politicians to address these challenges, thereby encouraging ongoing dialogue. 

While the response maintains a logical sequence of ideas, it lacks explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors that could better emphasize the connections between different parts of the summary. However, it does succeed in providing a clear and organized overview of the text. In contrast, a response with a score of 1 would merely list events without any flow or connections between them, making it difficult for the reader to follow. Therefore, given the comparative analysis and the presence of well-developed ideas, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4 or 5 according to the rubric's emphasis on coherence and flow. However, it would receive a higher score if it incorporated more explicit linking phrases or devices to highlight the relationship between ideas. 

So, in conclusion, while the response shows a strong understanding of the content and maintains a clear and logical narrative, it would benefit from the inclusion of more explicit coherence tools.

salamandra-base,"Based on the provided text and the evaluation criteria outlined in the score rubric, it is clear that the response is a concise summary of a complex discussion on the development of a new train line. However, while it manages to cover several key points, such as the opposition from the Spanish government and the potential cost, the response lacks the explicit coherence found in a higher scoring response. There are no clear temporal connectors or discourse markers, which makes the overall flow of ideas less than optimal.

The summary does make an attempt at connecting the ideas within each paragraph, although these connections are not as clearly delineated as they could be. For example, it begins by highlighting the lack of interest from the Spanish government and the absence of an orzamentary part for the new train line in the 2021 budget. However, it fails to explicitly connect the following discussion about the Portuguese government’s perspective and their proposed changes to the Cumio Hispano-Portugués resolution. 

Although there are some implicit coherencies, such as the transition from discussing the Spanish government’s stance to the Portuguese government’s stance, the overall coherence of the response could be improved by including more explicit connectors and discourse markers. By doing so, the response would provide a more fluid and structured narrative that better demonstrates the sequence of events and the development of ideas throughout the discussion. 

Despite these shortcomings, the response still manages to convey the essential information from the text in a coherent manner, making it easier for readers to understand the complex issue at hand. Therefore, based on the evaluation criteria, the response can be considered as a reasonable summary that has made an effort to connect ideas, although it falls short of achieving the level of explicit coherence that would be necessary for a score of 5. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"The response contains a listing of events which seem to be out of chronological order. There's no clear progression of ideas, making the summary feel more like a random list rather than a cohesive narrative. Furthermore, there is a lack of explicit connectors that tie the sentences together, leading to a fragmented summary that does not build upon the previous points. This is reflected in the absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers which are crucial in maintaining coherence throughout the text. 

While the individual elements are present, they are not interconnected in a way that creates a seamless narrative. The disjointed nature of the summary makes it difficult to follow the story and understand the overall context and meaning. This lack of explicit coherence in the response makes it fall short of the standards set in the score rubric, which emphasizes the importance of structure and coherence in the summary. 

Therefore, considering the lack of clarity and continuity in the presentation of information, the response receives a score of 1 according to the score rubric.

salamandra-base,"This response maintains the necessary flow and coherence as required by the score rubric. The writer successfully summarizes the key events of the U.S. presidential election, focusing on the contention between Trump and Biden. The chronological flow of events is clear, with the respondent starting from the morning of the day after the elections, detailing the progress of the recounts and the legal battles that ensued. The summarization of the situation is cohesive, with the narrative progressing from the initial confusion about the president-elect to the current situation with the legal challenges. This structure and connectivity provide a solid summary that would be understandable to someone familiar with the context. The use of phrases like ""por todo"" and ""según el recuento"" serves to explicitly connect the events and ideas being presented. Furthermore, the mention of specific states where the recounts are still ongoing demonstrates a good grasp of the geographical focus of the election. So, the response exhibits explicit coherence and aligns with the quality question of structure and coherence. Therefore, the score is 5.  [RESULT] 5",5
salamandra-base,"This response does not provide a summary of the given text. It lists the names of representatives from various financial and business entities. While this information is relevant to the topic of the Capital Network, it lacks coherence and fails to follow the structure and flow of the original text. There is no mention of the objectives of the Capital Network, the specific EBT companies it is aimed at supporting, or the outcome of the forums. The absence of these crucial elements makes the response less useful for understanding the content and importance of the event. Furthermore, the response does not include any sort of connectors or markers to link the individual points into a coherent narrative, which is a significant aspect of a well-structured summary according to the score rubric. In light of these observations, it can be concluded that this response does not meet the criteria for a coherent and structured summary, and therefore would be scored poorly according to the provided rubric.

There is no mention of the specific allegations made by the CIG, nor any reference to the changes in the number of school units and staff. The response also neglects to discuss the reactions of both the Consellaría and the CIG to the issue at hand, which is crucial for understanding the full scope of the conflict. Furthermore, the inclusion of general statements about the situation and its implications does not align with the requirement for a structured and coherent summary. The lack of explicit coherence and the presence of random thoughts in the response suggest that the summary is not well-organized and therefore does not meet the criteria outlined in the score rubric. So the overall score is 1. [RESULT] 1",1

Although it mentions several relevant events, such as the public denunciation by AGADV, the involvement of the Garda Civil, and the commitment to seek justice and support the victim and her family, it lacks the narrative structure necessary for comprehension and engagement. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that help to link the different elements together to form a cohesive summary. This results in a fragmented understanding of the events described. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary fails to meet the expectations of coherence and narrative flow.

salamandra-base,"This summary does not present the necessary coherence required by the rubric. The sentences are disjointed and there is a significant lack of linkage or transition that would establish a clear narrative. The summarization appears to be a collection of isolated statements rather than a connected and cohesive narrative that flows from one idea to the next. Additionally, the absence of an organized structure that would guide the reader through the events reduces the clarity and effectiveness of the summary. Consequently, the summary does not adequately fulfill the task of summarizing the given text in a manner that demonstrates coherence. It is critical that each sentence contributes to building a coherent body of information about a topic, which this summary fails to accomplish. Therefore, it falls short in terms of structure, coherence, and explicit connection between ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-base,"The provided summary lacks a clear, coherent narrative. The events are listed without any form of linking or transition, making it difficult to follow the story. The sentences are isolated, and there is no clear beginning or end to the summary. There is also a lack of detail that would provide context and understanding to the reader. The use of a list instead of integrating the events into a narrative makes the summary disjointed and incohesive. This approach fails to meet the requirements for coherence as outlined in the score rubric. 

Therefore, considering the coherence criterion in the score rubric, which emphasizes the need for a well-structured and organized summary, the response falls short. The absence of connectors to weave the events into a continuous narrative further detracts from the overall coherence of the summary. So the overall score is 1, as it does not meet the basic requirements of coherence and organization in a summary.

salamandra-base,"The provided response does a good job at summarizing the given text. It effectively conveys the key achievements of Ana Peleteiro in the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, and her impact on the history of Galician athletes in the Olympics. However, while the content is accurate and informative, the response could benefit from the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers, as outlined in the score rubric, to improve the flow and coherence of the information. The response, as it stands, maintains an implicit coherence but could be enhanced with explicit linking words or phrases to better guide the reader through the sequence of events. This would help in clearly marking the relationship between the ideas and sentences. 

In terms of the flow of ideas, the response provides a clear narrative but does not use connectors to explicitly connect the information, which might affect the overall coherence. For example, stating that Ana's performance was ""acadar a terceira posición"" and then moving on to her personal best without explicitly linking the two events could potentially leave the reader with a disjointed understanding of the narrative.

In light of the score rubric, which emphasizes the importance of textual resources in creating explicit coherence, the response could be improved by incorporating these elements to enhance the summary's structure and organization. The use of explicit connectors would allow for a seamless transition between different pieces of information, thereby improving the response's coherence. 

So, while the summary does provide a coherent body of information, the use of explicit connectors could help in enhancing the overall flow of ideas. As such, the response does not fully meet the criteria for explicit coherence as laid out in the score rubric. Thus, the overall score for this response is 4.

It does not utilize connectors or discourse markers that would link the information about the association, its objectives, and the specific actions being taken. Additionally, the content of the original text is not fully encapsulated, as the response merely mentions the demands without explaining the context or the significance of these demands in relation to the scarcity of services in the region. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 2 because, while it contains relevant information, it lacks the explicit coherence and the proper structuring that would make it a well-organized and coherent summary.

It maintains a logical sequence of events, which is essential to a coherent summary. However, the response lacks explicit coherence. While the events are presented in a logical sequence, there are no discourse markers or temporal connectors that explicitly show the relationships between ideas and sentences. This could be improved by incorporating such textual resources, as suggested in the score rubric. Despite this, the response remains largely clear and logically consistent. Thus, while the response meets the criteria of coherence, it could be enhanced by the inclusion of explicit coherence resources.

salamandra-5w1h,"This response successfully integrates the 5W1H method, effectively summarizing the content of the original text. It provides a concise summary, with each sentence dedicated to answering a specific question, creating an organized structure that aligns well with the score rubric. The phrases in each bulletpoint are developed, demonstrating a strong sense of coherence and understanding of the text's core themes. Additionally, this response maintains a logical progression of ideas, which is crucial for achieving high scores according to the rubric. By linking various pieces of information together, this response not only answers the 5W1H questions but also shows how these elements interrelate within the context of the festival. The overall cohesion and flow of information further illustrate the quality of the summary. Therefore, considering the clarity, structure, and comprehensiveness of the summary, it meets the criteria of the score rubric to a high degree. So the score is 5.

salamandra-5w1h,"The response fails to maintain coherence, with a disjointed series of questions and answers rather than a summarization. While it touches upon several aspects of the original text, such as the purpose of the new web platform and the availability of academic content, it does so in a manner that lacks cohesion and flow. The summary jumps from one point to another without providing the necessary transition phrases, thus making it difficult to follow. Furthermore, the repetition of similar questions, like ""Para que fin se creou este espazo web?"" and ""Cal é o obxectivo principal deste proxecto?"", adds to the fragmented nature of the summary. In essence, the summary feels like a list of unrelated questions, rather than a coherent summary of the original text. Therefore, it fails to meet the expectations of the score rubric for coherence and flow, which emphasizes the importance of a well-structured and connected body of information.

salamandra-5w1h,"The response given appears to be a fragmented summary that lacks internal coherence and cohesiveness. It has multiple sentences that can be linked but they do not build upon each other to form a clear narrative. For instance, the opening sentence about the origin of the information is abruptly followed by a set of facts that do not flow logically into each other. There is no mention of a temporal or causal relationship between these facts. Additionally, the response lacks explicit connectors, which are crucial for creating a coherent summary.

The summarization of the text was carried out in a way that does not reflect a thoughtful synthesis of the information presented. Each point seems to be treated as an isolated fact rather than being integrated into a cohesive summary. Furthermore, the response fails to capture the nuances of the text and the interconnectedness of the information provided.

Given these observations, it is clear that the response does not meet the criteria for coherence as outlined in the score rubric. It does not provide a coherent body of information about the topic at hand. Instead, it reads like a set of disjointed statements, failing to build from sentence to sentence to create a seamless narrative. This results in a summary that is difficult to follow and does not reflect a comprehensive understanding of the text.

Therefore, based on the score rubric, which emphasizes coherence, the response lacks the necessary elements to form a coherent summary. As such, the response would be assigned a score of 1, as it is a bulletpoint list of events without any internal consistency.

salamandra-5w1h,"The summary provided seems to hit the high points of the original text without going into much detail. It does maintain a certain coherence by addressing the main themes presented in the text, namely the issues of rural depopulation, the importance of promoting economic activities, and the need for improvements in public services. However, the response could benefit from more explicit connectors to help guide the reader through the text, and to create a stronger sense of causation between the different elements discussed.

The response presents the information in a way that builds upon itself, but it lacks the specific textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence of the summary. While the ideas are loosely connected, the absence of explicit markers or connectors may cause the reader to struggle with the flow of the text, particularly when it comes to understanding the relationship between the different points made.

In contrast, a response that scored a 5 would have utilized more explicit coherence techniques, such as linking the main themes to the preceding and subsequent statements to ensure that the narrative follows a logical progression from one idea to the next. This approach would make it easier for the reader to follow the argument and grasp the overall message of the text.

So, while the response does maintain a degree of coherence, it falls short in providing explicit connectors that could have helped to strengthen the flow of ideas throughout the text.

salamandra-5w1h,"Upon examining the response provided, it is evident that it contains several sentences that effectively utilize the 5W1H method to summarize the text. However, the overall coherence of the summary is compromised due to the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers, which is a critical aspect in demonstrating the relationship between ideas and sentences. While the individual sentences do present the necessary information, the lack of explicit coherence reduces the flow of ideas and results in a less organized and connected summary. Therefore, the response receives a score of 3, as it meets the requirements of having well-developed phrases within each bulletpoint, but falls short of establishing explicit connections between the different points being discussed.

There are sentences that aim to convey what the event was about, such as the description of the event as a forum for innovative projects and the objectives of the Capital Network. However, the response lacks the systematic structure required by the 5W1H method. 

For example, the response fails to explicitly address the ""when"" by clearly stating the date of the event. Additionally, it does not specifically mention the ""where"" and ""who"" in a structured way. The response also lacks the explanation of ""why"" the event was held, which is essential in understanding the purpose and outcomes of the Capital Network. 

Moreover, the flow of ideas in the response is not as well-organized as it could be, with some sentences appearing disjointed from the overall narrative. This could lead to confusion and make it difficult for the reader to follow the key points of the original text. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response does not demonstrate explicit coherence and misses several aspects of the 5W1H method. While it captures the overall theme of the event, it falls short in providing a structured summary that adheres to the given instructions. 

Considering the requirements set forth by the score rubric, it is clear that this response is not as strong as it could be in terms of coherence and alignment with the 5W1H method.

salamandra-5w1h,"The given response displays a lack of structural and coherent development in comparison to the expected level. It uses bullet points to denote each aspect of the instruction, yet these aspects lack clear transitions, leading to a disjointed narrative. The use of different tenses and a mix of future and past tense further complicates the understanding of the summary. Additionally, the summary does not effectively utilize temporal connectors or discourse markers, which could have helped to construct a more cohesive narrative.

In terms of content, the summary captures the essence of the text by mentioning the key aspects, such as the criticism from the CIG, the reduction in the number of units and staff, and the future actions planned by the CIG. However, the way these elements are presented is not as structured as it could be, making it difficult to follow the flow of events. The summary also fails to adequately address the needs and sensitivities of the community and does not propose a coherent course of action to address the situation.

While there is an effort to summarize the text, the response falls short in delivering a coherent and organized summary that would align with the DUC quality question. The elements of the summary are mentioned, but they lack the necessary connections to form a cohesive narrative. As a result, the response is more of a list of events rather than a coherent summary. 

In conclusion, the summary's structure and organization are lacking, and the absence of clear transitions and textual resources for explicit coherence results in a fragmented summary that fails to build a coherent body of information about the topic.

salamandra-5w1h,"The response demonstrates a list-like structure, which does not adhere to the coherent flow required by the 5W1H method. Each person or organization is introduced separately, without any context or connections that might link them together. The format is more akin to a set of questions and answers, rather than a flowing narrative. Although the events are mentioned, they lack the interconnectivity necessary for coherence, as there is no progression or development of ideas. There are no temporal or causal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow of information. Therefore, it fails to meet the criteria of building from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information about the topic. 

In terms of the content itself, the events are mentioned, but they do not provide a complete picture of what happened. There is no mention of the chronological order of events, nor any indication of the cause-and-effect relationship between them. This makes it difficult to understand the full scope of the incident and its aftermath.

Additionally, while the response is mostly accurate, it does not fully capture the depth of the information provided in the original text, particularly regarding the motivations behind the events and the reactions of the involved parties. This lack of detail and context makes the summary less informative than it could be.

There are no discourse markers such as 'and', 'but', or 'then' to show transitions between different events or perspectives. Additionally, while the response is coherent, it does not offer a highly detailed account of the events described. The use of ambiguous phrases like ""diversos incidentes"" and ""publicly"" can leave some ambiguity in the summary.

salamandra-tldr,"This response reiterates the same information four times without adding new information or creating a coherent narrative. The repetition of the demand for a local space to open a therapy center and better healthcare services at the local hospital does not contribute to building a comprehensive summary. The lack of development and variation in sentence structure indicates a lack of coherence. While there is no explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, the sentences have a temporal/causal flow and there is no incorrect information or random words. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary is not well-structured or organized and does not build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic. This is why the summary does not meet the criteria of explicit coherence and is therefore graded as a score 2. [RESULT] 2",2

The narrative flows smoothly, yet the text does not provide explicit markers of temporal or causal relationships between ideas and sentences. The information is presented in a clear and structured manner, which makes it easy to follow. It maintains a coherent narrative throughout, despite the complexity of the events being described. The use of conjunctions and logical linkage helps to create a sense of continuity, which contributes to the overall coherence of the text. This aligns with the requirement for implicit coherence, as outlined in the score rubric. However, a more explicit use of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers could further enhance the coherence and readability of the text.

The flow of ideas is logical and coherent, effectively summarizing key points such as the breadth of content available, the facilities provided by the new website, and the inclusion of important historical texts. The mention of the Public Knowledge Project offers additional context and connects the initiative to broader academic goals.

However, the response could have provided more explicit connectors to enhance the coherence of the summary. For instance, the inclusion of specific text types like ""explicit coherence via textual resources"" could have served as a discourse marker, illustrating the role of specific texts in the context of the summary.

In light of these observations, while the response does a good job in summarizing the key points and maintaining coherence, there is room for improvement in terms of using textual resources to explicitly connect ideas. This would have provided a clearer link between the various aspects of the new initiative, thereby making the summary even more coherent. 

Based on these observations, the response achieves a score of 4 as it has implicit coherence but lacks explicit connectors.

salamandra-tldr,"The response demonstrates an understanding of the complexities involved in analyzing Galician digital divide data. However, while the response manages to present the essential information, it falls short in articulating this information in a manner that builds a coherent narrative. The response consists of a series of statements that, while related, are not connected in a way that allows the reader to follow the argument through. For instance, the sentence ""Ademais, o 16,4% da poboación galega fai compras por internet nos últimos tres meses, cun aumento dun 13,9% desde 2010-2011, superando así a media nacional"" is a factual statement about the increase in online shopping in Galicia, but it does not follow from the preceding statement about the lower Internet usage among older generations. Similarly, the statement ""Do mesmo xeito, os mozos galegos de 16 a 44 anos utilizan internet máis que a media nacional, pero as persoas maiores de 45 anos utilízanlo moito menos"" presents the differing levels of Internet use across different age groups, but does not connect back to the earlier discussion of the urban-rural divide. This lack of explicit coherence and connection between ideas prevents the response from fully satisfying the criteria for a higher score. 

In contrast, a higher scoring response would link the various pieces of information together in a way that allows the reader to see the interrelationships and to understand how one piece of data contributes to another, creating a coherent narrative that reflects the overall analysis of the data. 

Therefore, while the response contains a wealth of information, it lacks the explicit coherence that would make it a more comprehensive and insightful analysis of the data.

salamandra-tldr,"When evaluating the coherence of the response, the internal consistency and the relationship between ideas and sentences are key factors to consider. The given response exhibits an impressive level of coherence, making it very easy to follow and understand. The response clearly articulates the purpose and goals of the Galicia Baleira platform, and it elaborates on the specific medias that are being proposed for the promotion of economic growth, the protection of public services, and the preservation of cultural and natural heritage in rural areas. This is done through the use of clear and direct statements, which maintain a logical flow from one idea to the next. Furthermore, the response demonstrates a strong understanding of the political climate and the necessary steps to take action. The speaker also engages in a rhetorical question, drawing attention to the lack of political action and the need for broader community involvement. This technique adds depth to the discussion and encourages further thought and reflection. Additionally, the speaker emphasizes the importance of public awareness and the involvement of different stakeholders in resolving the issues at hand. These elements contribute to the overall coherence and effectiveness of the response. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
salamandra-tldr,"The response effectively presents a comprehensive overview of the dispute between the governments of Spain and Portugal regarding the implementation of the high-speed train between Vigo and Portugal. The text is structured in a way that provides context, followed by the conflicting interests of both countries. The response also touches upon the complexity of the situation and the ambiguous stance of the Spanish government. However, the response could benefit from a more explicit use of connectors to guide the reader through the sequence of events, thereby enhancing the overall coherence of the text. In the absence of explicit discourse markers, the response achieves a degree of coherence by maintaining a logical flow of ideas. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which assesses the coherence of a summary, the response exhibits a fair level of structure and connectivity, and, thus, it can be rated as a 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"The summary provided for Samuel Luiz's asasinato lacks the detailed information necessary for full comprehension. While it does mention the age of the victim, the location of the crime, and the involvement of police forces, it falls short in terms of coherence and development of ideas. The response also lacks the incorporation of important details, such as the identity of Avante LGTBI+, the exact nature of the crime, and the specific call to action regarding future concentrations. 

Additionally, the summary does not utilize any textual resources that could enhance the clarity and flow of the narrative. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help in understanding the sequence of events. The response presents the information in a simple list format without any development or connection between the points made. This leads to a disjointed and fragmented understanding of the event.

Considering the evaluation criteria, which emphasizes the need for coherence and flow of ideas, the response fails to meet these standards. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response would receive a score of 1 as it presents a disjointed list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative that connects the events and their implications. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-tldr,"The response effectively summarizes the unfolding situation regarding the U.S. presidential election. It maintains a logical progression of information, starting with the current standings and moving to the key battles and potential outcomes. The flow of ideas is smooth, building upon the prior sentence to construct a coherent narrative about the election and the legal challenges involved.

There is a clear understanding of the topic at hand, and the sentences are well-connected and relevant to the overall discussion. However, the response could have included more explicit connections between ideas to strengthen its coherence. The absence of such elements leaves the reader with a less structured perception of the information.

Additionally, the response might have benefited from the use of explicit connectors, such as transitional phrases or temporal markers, to better signal the progression of ideas and to clarify the relationships between events and outcomes.

Overall, while the response demonstrates a good level of coherence and understanding, it falls slightly short of the explicit connection quality outlined in the score rubric. Therefore, based on the given criteria, the response is evaluated as being coherent but not explicitly so. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"The response provides a summary of the event, mentioning the initiatives presented, their sectors, and the total investment required. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence, which means there are no textual resources, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would connect the ideas and sentences more effectively. Despite this, the response maintains a general chronological flow, moving from the event itself to the description of the proxects and the total investment required. The summary, while coherent to some extent, does not employ clear linguistic devices to establish strong relationships between the ideas being conveyed. As such, the response is considered to meet the requirements of a score of 4. It shows implicit coherence, with sentences having a temporal/causal flow, but without explicit coherence through the use of textual resources. Therefore, the response would receive a score of 4 based on the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"The provided response presents a clear and concise summary of the situation involving the reduction of school units and teachers, as well as the response of the CIG and the broader context of the pandemic. However, it lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers to fully link the various elements of the issue at hand. For instance, it could improve by better linking the accusation of the CIG to the actions taken by the Consellería. Additionally, while the summary touches upon the implications of the reductions for the students and the teaching staff, it doesn't fully explore the potential consequences or the motivations behind the Consellería's decisions. These aspects could be further developed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the issue. Despite these shortcomings, the summary is coherent and well-organized, presenting the information in a logical sequence. So the overall score is 4.

salamandra-tldr,"The response provides a condensed summary of the event described in the instruction, focusing on the key aspects such as the attack, the actions of the police and the community, and the call for action. While it presents the facts correctly, the response lacks a smooth transition between ideas, making it appear more like a list of disconnected events rather than a coherent narrative. This is reflected in the absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers that could provide a better flow of information. Furthermore, it omits important details such as the involvement of the candidates for the local election and the specific actions taken by the authorities and the community, which are essential to fully understand the severity of the situation. The summary could be improved by incorporating these elements and providing a clearer structure to guide the reader through the events in a logical manner. So the overall score is 3. [RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-tldr,"The response successfully condenses the complex events into a concise summary. However, it does not maintain the coherence found in the higher scoring responses. The summary contains a sequence of events which seems disconnected, leading to a loss in cohesiveness. The structure of the summary, while organized, does not provide clear temporal connections or transitions between the different incidents. This lack of explicit coherence, as required by the score rubric, can be identified through the absence of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that are crucial in forming a coherent body of information. Therefore, although the summary is not a simple list of events, it does not fully meet the expectations of a score 5. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"This response lacks the necessary coherence and connectivity expected from a summary of the events. While the events themselves are mentioned, there is a lack of logical progression and coherence in the narrative. There are no transitions or connectors used to guide the reader through the series of events. Moreover, the information is not presented in a manner that builds upon itself, making it difficult for the reader to follow the story. The details of the events are presented in a list-like format without clear linkages between them. This response does not meet the criteria for coherence and structuring, which is crucial in summarizing complex events. The reader is left with fragmented information that does not provide a clear understanding of the narrative. Therefore, based on the score rubric's criteria for coherence, the response is not satisfactory in its structure and flow. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-tldr,"In the context of the score rubric, this response shows an attempt to connect events but lacks the explicit coherence needed for higher scores. While the summary mentions Ana Peleteiro's success at the Olympics and provides a link to a source, it fails to detail the exact circumstances leading to her winning the bronze medal. It does not explicitly connect the ideas of her successful performance and its historical significance. There is a clear mention of the event, but there are no connectors to build a coherent narrative about the atleta's journey. 

Moreover, the summary lacks the depth provided by the other references, such as mentioning her previous achievements and the specific context in which she won the bronze medal. The summary's lack of detail and explicit connections between sentences is why it is scored at a 3. It provides a general outline but misses the opportunity to delve deeper into the narrative and provide a richer understanding of the event. 

So, while the response is coherent, it is not as richly detailed and does not build on ideas as effectively as the reference answer. This results in a somewhat fragmented summary that doesn't fully capture the excitement and significance of Peleteiro's victory. 

Overall, the summary contains implicit coherence, which is why it is scored at a 3. 
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt5-base,"The summary in the response demonstrates a high level of coherence by building upon the information provided in the original text. Each sentence contributes to an overarching narrative about the Asociación de Pacientes Finisterrae and its demands, the area's healthcare needs, and the implications of these needs on the community's health. There are clear connections between ideas, allowing the reader to understand the sequence of events and the urgency of the situation.

The response begins by introducing the Asociación, its purpose, and the specific demand it has made to the concello. It then seamlessly transitions into the issues surrounding the Costa da Morte, detailing the stark lack of healthcare resources in the area and how it impacts the local population. The inclusion of facts about the population density and the distance to the nearest hospital add depth to the summary, reinforcing the severity of the situation. Furthermore, the explicit mention of the need for a UCI with 24-hour service and the implantation of more specialties clarifies the precise nature of the support being sought.

In terms of coherence, the summary progresses logically from one idea to another, without any abrupt shifts. The narrative flows smoothly, with each sentence serving as a bridge to the next, thereby maintaining internal consistency throughout. The response effectively utilizes temporal connectors, such as ""leva anos,"" and a clear causal flow to link the different aspects of the problem. This not only provides a concise summary of the original text but also preserves the critical information, making it a well-structured and well-organized summary. 

In conclusion, the summary in the response excels in presenting a cohesive and well-developed narrative. It successfully adheres to the score rubric's requirement for explicit coherence through textual resources, maintaining a logical sequence of ideas and demonstrating a high degree of internal consistency.

gpt5-base,"The response provides a coherent summary of the events following the asasinato of Jimmy. It successfully builds upon each sentence to create a comprehensive overview of the situation. However, it lacks explicit textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would enhance the coherence between ideas. The summary transitions smoothly from one point to another, maintaining a clear chronological flow without explicitly stating the relationships between sentences. Although it captures the essence of the text, it could further benefit from the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers to strengthen the link between the events described. This lack of explicit coherence is why it does not meet the highest standards of the score rubric. So the overall score is 4.

gpt5-base,"This response maintains a degree of coherence throughout, with the ideas flowing logically from one sentence to another. However, it lacks explicit coherence markers such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary connects the events in a chronological order but does not clearly signpost transitions or emphasize relationships between ideas. The information about the festival's content and activities is presented in a series of connected sentences. The phrases within each sentence are relevant and well-developed, which shows a level of understanding and organization. Despite these positive aspects, the absence of explicit connectors reduces the overall coherence of the summary, making it less effective in guiding the reader through the complex information presented. The response is strong but would benefit from the addition of explicit coherence elements to enhance its effectiveness. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-base,"This response provides a comprehensive summary of the text in question. It clearly identifies the key elements of the text, such as the availability of monographies and the integration of previous publications like the Boletín, Cadernos de lingua, and La Tribuna. It also touches on the functionality of the portal and its alignment with the objectives of the Public Knowledge Project. The response successfully maintains a logical flow from one sentence to the next, providing a cohesive summary of the event. There is an implicit coherence, although it lacks explicit markers such as temporal connectors that would have strengthened the relationship between the ideas presented. This results in a slightly less coherent flow compared to a higher scoring response, which would ideally incorporate these elements to enhance the clarity of the summary. Nevertheless, the response remains well-structured and clearly articulates the main points of the text.

gpt5-base,"The summary presented effectively employs temporal connectors and discourse markers, enabling a clear and coherent narrative. The use of phrases like ""pero segue por detrás"" and ""existe un debil en"" establish a logical progression from one idea to another, while the mention of contrasting percentages from different age groups illustrates a distinct and coherent section about age differences in internet usage. Moreover, the transition from discussing internet access to discussing the growth of internet usage and electronic commerce is seamless, further enhancing the overall coherence of the summary. The explicit nature of the coherence tools used in the summary makes it easy for the reader to follow the text and understand the relationship between ideas and sentences. Thus, according to the score rubric, the response shows a high level of structure and coherence in presenting the information. Therefore, the response is graded at a score of 5.

gpt5-base,"The response exhibits a clear flow and connectivity between ideas, aligning closely with the criteria set in the score rubric. The summary follows a logical progression, beginning with the presentation of the plataforma and its objectives, then moving into the specifics of the proposed medidas. It then shifts to discussing the need for infrastructure and technological advancements, before concluding with the political aspects of the situation. The connective language and the well-structured sentences provide a coherent narrative that takes the reader through the various facets of the rural issue in Galicia. The response also contains explicit references to previous points, effectively demonstrating the use of discourse markers to link the ideas together. Therefore, based on the rubric, the response achieves a score of 5 due to its explicit coherence and excellent flow of ideas.

gpt5-base,"In evaluating the response, it becomes apparent that there are several interconnected issues raised by the different stakeholders involved in this discussion. However, the clarity and coherence of these issues are not as effectively communicated as they could be. The response presents the different perspectives and standpoints, but it lacks explicit connectors or markers that could have helped guide the reader through the complex narrative of this issue. For example, phrases like ""despite culping"" or ""mostra pouca vontade"" could have been better connected with the previous sentence to enhance the flow of information. While the sentences generally follow a logical sequence, their connectivity is less than optimal, which could potentially cause confusion for the reader. This impacts the overall coherence of the response, as the lack of explicit markers can make it harder for the reader to follow the thread of the conversation. In conclusion, although the response addresses the main points, the lack of explicit connectors results in a less coherent summary compared to a score of 5.

gpt5-base,"The response is a summarized account of the events and circumstances surrounding the death of Samuel Luiz. It successfully condenses the detailed narrative into a coherent and organized summary, reflecting the structure and flow expected from a well-crafted response. It maintains a logical progression of ideas, detailing the nature of the crime, the victim's background, and the ongoing investigation by the Policía Nacional. Moreover, it addresses the continued demonstrations across various cities in Galicia. This clear articulation of the sequence of events and its impact aligns well with the scoring rubric's requirement for explicit coherence. It effectively uses discourse markers to connect the various aspects of the crime, its aftermath, and the community's reaction. Therefore, the response achieves a high degree of coherence and adherence to the quality expected as per the rubric. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt5-base,"The response begins by acknowledging the uncertainty after the elections, which aligns with the initial content of the instruction. It then logically progresses through the key points of the narrative, starting with Trump's initial resistance, the revelation of his possible advantage through advanced voting and mail-in ballots, the significant victories in Michigan and Wisconsin, and the discrepancy between the required 270 votes and the current count. This progression indicates a coherent structure that effectively conveys the central developments.

Furthermore, the response includes an element of suspense and conflict by introducing Trump's legal actions against potential fraud. The mention of the specific states where the race is still close provides additional detail that aids in understanding the stakes of these legal actions. Additionally, the final note about the possibility of Biden winning Arizona and Nevada to reach the required 270 votes adds a further layer of complexity and uncertainty to the narrative.

Although the summary does not include explicit connectors or discourse markers, it achieves a sense of coherence through the logical sequencing of the events. The overall narrative flows from one point to another, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the situation.

Considering these aspects, it is evident that the summary maintains a coherent structure without compromising on detail or clarity. This level of coherence, along with the ability to succinctly convey complex information, aligns well with the evaluation criteria. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response demonstrates a high degree of coherence, which warrants a score of 5.

gpt5-base,"The response is well-organized and coherent, effectively summarizing the key points of the event. It covers the main objectives of the forum, such as promoting interaction between innovative projects and potential investors, and the aim to support the creation and expansion of EBT. Moreover, it presents the nine selected Galician projects, detailing their specific natures, such as a correction software, a system for emergency situations, and an indoor location system. This demonstrates an understanding of the various topics discussed.

However, the response falls short in providing explicit coherence. Although the ideas are presented in a logical order, there is a lack of discourse markers or temporal connectors, which could have further clarified the sequence of events and the interconnectedness of the various elements. Nevertheless, the summary is able to convey the necessary information in a manner that is understandable and coherent, even without these additional connectors.

Given the lack of explicit coherence, but the presence of a structured and organized flow of ideas, the response aligns more closely with a score of 4 according to the rubric provided. The response's organization and the logical flow of the ideas presented would likely receive a higher score if the feedback criteria focused more on the explicit coherence aspect. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

The summary maintains a consistent narrative, and each sentence builds upon the previous one, contributing to the overall coherence of the summary. This seamless flow ensures that the reader can easily follow the narrative. However, there is room for improvement, as the summary could benefit from explicit connections between the different points discussed. The use of temporal or causal connectors would have made the summary even more effective in terms of coherence and flow. This minor shortcoming is the reason why the response does not receive the highest score. Nevertheless, considering the fact that the summary has a logical flow and remains consistent throughout, it is clear that the response does meet the criteria for a score of 4.

gpt5-base,"The response does a decent job summarizing the given text. It manages to encapsulate the key events and reactions in the aftermath of the incident. The summary begins by setting the scene of Vimianzo being impacted by another case of gender-based violence. This is followed by a detailed account of the incident itself, where Javier M. attacked Montse López. The summary continues by describing the authorities' response, highlighting the condemnation of the event and the various concentrations that occurred in its wake. It also touches upon the political and social implications, summarizing the stance of different political entities and community organizations. The response demonstrates implicit coherence, which is evident through the smooth transition from one event to the next and the logical progression of ideas. However, it falls short of demonstrating explicit coherence as there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to clearly indicate the relationships between ideas and sentences. Despite this, the overall flow of ideas remains clear and logical. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 4, as it contains implicit coherence but lacks explicit coherence.

Furthermore, it explains the incidents, mentioning the detection of the packages in Barcelona and Madrid, and the threats received by the individuals. The summary maintains a coherent flow, transitioning smoothly from one event to another. It does so by keeping a logical sequence that reflects the temporal and causal relationships between the facts presented. Additionally, the summary is concise, containing only necessary information, and uses relevant phrases from the original text, thus maintaining the original message's essence. While the summary is well-structured and coherent, it lacks explicit connectors such as 'then', 'so', or 'therefore' which would make the transitions between events clearer. Therefore, although the summary maintains implicit coherence, it could be improved by adding explicit connectors to mark the relationship between ideas more clearly.

It covers the critical aspects, such as the incident where Irene was physically and verbally assaulted, the subsequent actions taken by the authorities, and the implications of this incident in the broader context of the political campaign.

However, the flow of information could be enhanced with the use of more explicit connectors to better demonstrate the sequence of events and the cause-and-effect relationship between them. For instance, phrases like ""preceding this, exacerbating that"" or ""in the aftermath of this, another event occurred"" could be utilized to help guide the reader through the narrative.

Furthermore, the inclusion of additional details regarding the responses of the community and the multifaceted issues at hand would provide a more nuanced and comprehensive summary. These could include the motives behind the community's opposition to the project, the financial interests behind the campaign, and the impact on the local environment and residents.

In terms of coherence, while the response does follow a logical progression of events, the absence of explicit connectors slightly reduces the clarity and flow of the narrative compared to a more sophisticated and structured approach. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 based on the rubric's criteria.

gpt5-base,"The summary provided for Ana Peleteiro's performance at the 2020 Olympic Games shows a good level of coherence, successfully summarizing the key events and accomplishments. The information flows from her entering the event to her achieving her first Olympic medal, and even includes the comparison with Yulimar Rojas and Patricia Mamona. However, it lacks explicit connectors, which could provide a more seamless narrative of the events. While the summary does follow a logical order and connects the events and outcomes, it would benefit from using connectors or other textual resources to indicate the relationships between these elements. For instance, it could have included transition phrases or sequential indicators to create a more explicit coherence. This slight lack of explicit connectors prevents it from receiving a perfect score of 5. Therefore, based on the score rubric, it demonstrates a good, but not perfect, level of coherence.

gpt5-5w1h,"The provided response exhibits a fair structure and organization. However, it does not fully align with the requirements of the score rubric which specifies the need for explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary in the response is indeed logically organized, yet it does not utilize explicit connectors between sentences to create a smooth transition of ideas, which is crucial for a well-structured summary. Despite this, the information presented in the summary does follow a temporal sequence, showing a chronological order from the creation of the association, to the current demands and problems faced by the association. Additionally, it reflects the intended coherence by keeping all elements within the confines of the 5W1H method. Nevertheless, the summary could benefit from more explicit markers of connection to further enhance its coherence and flow. Based on these observations, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4 as per the rubric. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"Upon examination of the provided text and the generated response, it's evident that both follow the 5W1H method, but the coherence of the response varies significantly. The initial text was dense, containing numerous complex ideas and multiple sources of information that had to be consolidated. The resulting summary must weave these ideas into a coherent narrative.

The response begins by identifying the key players and the event that started it all - the murder of Jimmy. It provides a clear overview of the main events, connecting the groups involved, the details of the investigation, and the implications for the wider community and for the sport of soccer in Spain. However, there is a noticeable lack of explicit connectors or discourse markers that would allow for a smoother transition between ideas and sentences. This leaves the reader to infer the connections between different pieces of information.

The flow of ideas, while generally logical, could benefit from a more explicit structural approach. For example, by using specific transition words or phrases to bridge the different elements of the narrative, it would be easier for the reader to follow the progression of events. This could include the use of words or phrases that signal the beginning or end of a narrative segment or that highlight the cause and effect relationships between events.

While the response is accurate and well-organized in terms of content, its ability to create a seamless and fluid summary is limited. Although it does a decent job at summarizing the text, it falls short in delivering a highly coherent and well-structured narrative that is easy to follow.

So, considering the rubric's emphasis on the collective quality of all sentences and the need for an explicit coherence structure, the response is rated a 4. It contains implicit coherence, which is a step up from the bulletpoint list format, but there are still areas for improvement in terms of explicit connectors and markers to enhance the flow of ideas.

The 5W1H approach is well-implemented, with each question being addressed in an organized and clear manner. Each sentence smoothly transitions to the next, ensuring the summary flows logically. There is a clear delineation of the event's aspects, which aligns with the rubric's demand for a well-structured and well-organized summary. The response not only presents key information but also maintains the coherence throughout. The explicit connectors used (e.g., ""Para consolidar"", ""Aquí tes o resumo"", ""En Compostela"") serve to bind the different elements of the festival, resulting in a comprehensive and cohesive summary. Thus, according to the rubric, this summary earns a score of 5 due to its ability to articulate a well-structured and interconnected body of information.

gpt5-5w1h,"The response provided has succeeded in capturing the essential information from the text and presenting it using the 5W1H format. It starts by asking ""What?"" and then systematically answers with a focus on the central aspects of the text. The summary, while well-structured, lacks explicit connectors that could further enhance the coherence between ideas and sentences. While it does include implicit temporal connectors that link the past and present state of the project, the absence of explicit linking phrases is noticeable. In terms of organization and flow, the response does manage to build from idea to idea, showing a reasonable understanding of the text and providing a coherent body of information. However, the additional use of explicit connectors or discourse markers would have elevated the quality of the summary by more clearly signaling the relationship between ideas and sentences. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"The provided summary adheres well to the 5W1H method, although it could have used more detailed textual resources for explicit coherence. The summary shows a good understanding of the text and presents the information in a structured and logical manner, indicating an internal consistency between the points made. However, the connectors between the ideas could have been more explicitly stated. While the response succeeds in summarizing the information in a coherent way, the absence of clear transition phrases or explicit temporal connectors slightly reduces its effectiveness in fully conveying the sequence of ideas. For instance, the statement ""Cando?"" could be enhanced by explicitly connecting it to the previous statement with a phrase like ""Desde entonces,"" to establish a clear temporal flow. Nonetheless, the summary effectively captures the main aspects of the text, and it shows a clear flow of ideas, meeting most of the criteria for a well-structured and coherent summary. 

So, based on the criteria of coherence and connection of ideas, the response does well, but there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence and connection of ideas, as per the score rubric. This would result in a more seamless and comprehensive summary, as per the criteria of a score 5 response.

gpt5-5w1h,"The summary provided maintains a coherent flow by connecting ideas through logical sequencing. Each section follows a logical progression of information, beginning with an introduction to the issue, moving on to discuss the impact of these issues, and concluding with suggestions for action. The use of cohesive phrases and transition words such as ""por que,"" ""como,"" and ""apóio suficiente,"" provide a clear connection between different parts of the text. This allows the reader to understand the progression of thoughts and ideas within the text. Moreover, the summary also reflects the temporal order of events, creating a sense of narrative and progression. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary effectively achieves explicit coherence through the use of textual resources, making it easy to follow and understand the context and issues being addressed.

gpt5-5w1h,"The response provided adheres to the required 5W1H method, however, it does not demonstrate the same level of coherence and flow of ideas as the reference answer. While it contains all necessary elements (who, what, when, where, why and how), the sentences in the summary are disjointed and lack the necessary connectors to form a coherent body of information. This makes it difficult for the reader to understand the sequence of events and the relationship between the various actors involved. Additionally, the summary is presented as a list of sentences, rather than a continuous narrative that builds upon itself, further hindering its coherence.

In contrast, the reference response exhibits explicit coherence, utilizing textual resources such as temporal connectors and discourse markers. The sentences are interconnected, allowing the reader to follow the progression of the discussion about the railway project. The use of connectors ensures that the summary flows logically, making it easier for the reader to grasp the complex issues at hand. The language employed in the reference response also enhances its coherence by maintaining a consistent tone and providing clear explanations of the differing perspectives of the Spanish and Portuguese governments.

Therefore, based on the score rubric which emphasizes the coherence and flow of ideas, the response provided falls short of the quality demonstrated in the reference response. While both responses are correct in terms of content, the superior organization and flow of ideas in the reference response are critical in effectively summarizing the original text. Thus, a score of 1 is more appropriate for the response provided, as it does not meet the criteria of coherence and flow of ideas as outlined in the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 1",1
gpt5-5w1h,"When examining the response, we notice that it maintains a structured format that aligns with the 5W1H method. Each point provides the necessary information regarding the what, who, when, where, why and how of the given situation. The response demonstrates coherence by providing a logical flow from one point to another. This helps in maintaining a clear understanding of the events and their significance.

However, while the response is structured, it lacks explicit connectors between the different elements. For instance, the response could have benefited from the use of transitional phrases or sentences that could better link the different parts of the summary. This would have improved the overall coherence of the summary.

Despite this, the response still manages to convey the necessary information in a coherent manner, and it does so without including incorrect or irrelevant information. Therefore, in line with the score rubric's emphasis on coherence, the response manages to build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about the topic at hand.

The lack of explicit connectors and transitional phrases in the response means that it does not fully meet the highest standards of the rubric, which calls for explicit coherence through textual resources. Yet, it does show a degree of implicit coherence, as the sentences have a temporal/causal flow. So the overall score for the response is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"The summary provided is well-structured, maintaining a clear progression of ideas through the use of the 5W1H method. Each question corresponds to a separate sentence, thereby giving the impression of a concise yet informative summary. The response manages to convey the essence of the original text without any apparent disconnect or confusion. There is also a noticeable flow of ideas, from introducing the situation to discussing the potential outcomes and current issues.

However, while the coherence of the summary is largely maintained, there could be an improvement in the explicitness of connectors between the sentences. For example, the sentences could be more explicitly connected by using conjunctions or other discourse markers to clarify the relationship between the different aspects of the scenario. This would not only enhance the coherence of the summary but also provide a clearer narrative.

Additionally, it is worth noting that the response could benefit from a slight expansion on certain points to provide a more comprehensive summary. For instance, details about the issues at hand or a brief discussion of the various strategies used by both candidates could add depth to the summary.

Given these observations, the response demonstrates a strong alignment with the scoring rubric, as it is well-structured and exhibits a good degree of coherence, even though it does not utilize explicit connectors between the sentences. The improvement suggested here is minor and does not significantly detract from the overall quality of the summary. Therefore, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"The response demonstrates an attempt to structure the information according to the 5W1H method. It covers all the elements: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. However, there are several shortcomings that affect the overall coherence of the summary. The response does not adequately provide the details required for each W. For example, while it mentions the forum's purpose, it fails to describe the context of the forum or the potential impact on the Galician economy. Additionally, the sentences do not smoothly transition from one W to the next, which creates a somewhat disjointed flow of information.

While the response touches on the main points of the text, it lacks depth and context. It mentions the investment necessary for the nine projects but does not explain how this investment will be used or why it is significant. Moreover, there is no clear distinction between the different types of entities that participated in the forum, nor is there an explanation of the role each entity played in the forum's success.

In conclusion, although the response does follow the required structure, it lacks the explicit coherence needed for the summary to be well-structured and well-organized. The summary's flow of ideas could be improved with the inclusion of explicit coherence through the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that clearly mark the relationships between ideas and sentences. Thus, it would be more beneficial to revise the response with these considerations in mind.

gpt5-5w1h,"In examining the response against the score rubric, the coherence of the summary is a significant factor. While the summary does not contain explicit coherence markers like temporal connectors or discourse markers, it maintains a structured flow of ideas. The sentences are logically connected, and the summary builds from one sentence to another in a coherent manner.

The use of the 5W1H method allows for a clear and concise summary of the original text. Each element (What, Who, When, Where, Why and How) is appropriately addressed, and the information flows naturally from one element to the next. The logical progression of ideas in the summary, from the issue at hand to the reactions and potential solutions, ensures that the reader can easily follow the narrative.

Despite the absence of explicit coherence markers, the summary is well-organized and maintains a clear and logical flow of information. The structure of the summary, with each sentence focusing on one aspect of the situation, demonstrates a strong alignment with the criteria of structure and coherence. The response shows that the content is well-structured and well-organized, without any confusing or disconnected sentences.

Based on these observations, the response fulfills the criteria of the score rubric for a score of 5. It demonstrates implicit coherence and maintains a logical progression of ideas throughout the summary. The absence of grammatical errors or incorrect information further enhances the overall quality of the response. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt5-5w1h,"The provided summary successfully employs the 5W1H method to organize and relay the main points of the given text. It demonstrates clear structure by presenting the ""what,"" ""who,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" of the incident, providing the reader with a comprehensive understanding of the event. However, it does not incorporate explicit connectors to enhance the coherence and flow of ideas. While the individual components are well-defined, the transition from one point to another could have been made smoother with the use of phrases or discourse markers to clearly indicate the sequence of events. Despite this, the summary maintains a logical progression and achieves the goal of providing an informative and organized overview of the described scenario. Therefore, according to the score rubric, while the summary contains implicit coherence and the ideas are presented in a logical order, it lacks explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"The summary successfully adheres to the 5W1H method, covering the key aspects of the text. Each query has been addressed comprehensively. However, there is room for improvement in terms of explicit coherence. The summary lacks explicit textual resources that connect the ideas and sentences together. There is a noticeable absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers, which are crucial for guiding the reader through the summary. Despite these shortcomings, the implicit coherence is present, with sentences flowing logically and temporally. The progression from the delivery of the threats to the reaction and investigation by the authorities is well-articulated, although not explicitly marked. Thus, the response would benefit from the incorporation of clearer connectors and explicit markers to better organize the information. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"In analyzing the provided response, it is important to assess the quality of the summary by considering the methodology and the flow of information. The response uses a structured approach, answering each of the 5W1H elements succinctly. It begins by identifying the events (what) and then describes the parties involved (who), followed by the context of the incident (when), the location (where), the cause (why), and the manner in which the incident occurred (how).

However, the response does not contain explicit coherence, as there are no textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that explicitly indicate the relationship between the ideas. While the sequence of sentences does convey a logical progression of information, the absence of these elements results in a less cohesive summary than what could be achieved.

The response does display an implicit coherence, where the sentences follow a temporal or causal flow. This is evident as the response transitions from one event to another, maintaining a logical narrative. Nevertheless, the lack of explicit markers for the coherence of the summary detracts from its overall quality.

In conclusion, while the response successfully addresses all aspects of the 5W1H method, the absence of explicit coherence markers limits its effectiveness. However, it is notable that the response provides a clear and coherent summary of the text. The coherence of the response is slightly hindered by the lack of explicit markers, but it still offers a well-structured summary of the topic. Therefore, the response is slightly better than what is expected for a score of 3. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-5w1h,"The response provides a succinct summary of the given text, following the 5W1H method. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which would involve the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers. The summary does follow a logical sequence, from the identification of the person involved to the reason for the success, followed by a brief description of the process. Nonetheless, the transitions between ideas could have been more explicit, such as by using phrases like 'Therefore', 'In consequence', or 'Thereafter'. This would have allowed for a more seamless flow of ideas, making the response even stronger. So, while the summary contains implicit coherence, it could benefit from more explicit connections between the ideas presented. Therefore, according to the scoring rubric, the response scores a 4 due to its implicit coherence, but misses the opportunity to enhance its flow through the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response effectively conveys the concerns and demands of the Asociación de Pacientes Finisterrae, despite the brevity and condensed nature of the message. It correctly identifies the association's main issues: the lack of a dedicated oncological center in Carnota, the insufficient resources in the local hospital, and the significant care gap across the Costa da Morte. Furthermore, it appropriately recognizes the limitations of the CHUS in Santiago de Compostela and the immense distance that patients in the region must travel to receive adequate medical care.

However, the response could have been improved by adding more explicit connectors to better illustrate the logical progression of ideas. Although the sentences do follow a coherent structure, the connections between the different aspects of the Asociación's needs are not as clearly outlined as they could be. This could have made it easier for the reader to understand the full scope of the association's demands.

Despite this, the response is coherent and provides a clear overview of the Asociación's situation. Therefore, it is considered to have achieved a score of 4 based on the score rubric, which recognizes the presence of implicit coherence in the text, without explicitly stating the relationships between ideas and sentences. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response adequately summarizes the events following the asassinato of an ultra from the Deportivo team. It touches upon the initial events, the ongoing investigation, and the aftermath involving the Frente Atlético, the Ultra Boys, and law enforcement. The narrative is presented in a cohesive manner, without evident grammatical errors, which aligns with the criteria for a score of 5 in terms of coherence. However, there are minor lapses in the flow of ideas, as the response jumps from the investigation to the impact on society and politics, without always providing smooth transitions between these topics. For instance, the connection between the initial arrests and the subsequent accusations could have been more explicitly stated. Nonetheless, these are minor issues that do not significantly hinder the overall understanding of the events. So, despite these minor issues, the summary maintains a clear and logical sequence of ideas, thus meeting the requirements for a score of 5 in coherence. 
[RESULT] 5",5
gpt5-tldr,"In this response, there is an attempt to summarize the event in a more organized manner than the initial input. However, there is a lack of explicit coherence or textual resources that help to connect the ideas or sentences together. Although the response lists the event details, it does so without much elaboration or connection to a larger narrative. The sentences, while structurally sound, stand more as a list of facts rather than a cohesive narrative. There are no clear temporal or causal connectors to guide the reader through the content of the festival. Despite these issues, the response still manages to present the necessary information and maintain a level of coherence. Therefore, the score is 3 as per the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
gpt5-tldr,"The response manages to succinctly encapsulate the essence of the event, providing a coherent flow of information. It captures the critical details about the new web portal, its purpose, and its features, all while maintaining a logical progression. The inclusion of specific examples, such as the discursos of Castelao or Otero Pedrayo, adds depth to the explanation and enhances the overall understanding of the platform's offerings. 

The response aligns well with the score rubric, exhibiting implicit coherence through the use of transitions to move from one idea to the next. However, it lacks explicit coherence, as it does not use temporal connectors or discourse markers that could further strengthen the relationship between ideas. Despite this, the response still presents a clear and understandable narrative about the new initiative by the Real Academia Galega.

The content of the response also avoids any glaring grammatical errors or incorrect information, which could have detracted from its overall coherence. Therefore, while the response could be slightly improved by incorporating explicit coherence, it remains a strong and informative summary of the event. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response provided does present a narrative about the digital divide in Galicia and its comparison with Spain and the EU. However, it lacks the explicit connectors and transitional phrases that provide a clear structure and logical progression. There is a sense of continuity in the text, yet the connections between different aspects of the issue are not explicitly stated or detailed. 

For example, while the response does mention the difference in Internet usage between urban and rural Galicia, as well as age groups, it does not explicitly explain how these factors contribute to the overall picture. Additionally, the response could benefit from more precise and contextual details, which would enhance its coherence and flow. 

In terms of language usage, the response does not exhibit any significant grammatical errors or incorrect information. The content is generally accurate and relevant to the topic. However, the lack of specific examples and detailed explanations further impacts the coherence and flow of the information presented. 

In summary, while the response contains some elements of coherence, it falls short of providing a well-structured and organized summary that builds from sentence to sentence to form a coherent body of information. The use of connectors or discourse markers could significantly improve the clarity and flow of the response. 

So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response provided is clear, coherent, and effectively communicates the main points of the initiative for Galicia Baleira. It presents the objectives of the platform, the proactive measures being proposed, and the issues it seeks to address, such as promoting economic activities, ensuring equal access to public services, and promoting sustainability through reforestation and renewable energy. Additionally, the response suggests a realistic and detailed approach to tackle the problem, reflecting a comprehensive understanding of the challenges faced by rural communities.

The ideas are well-organized and the use of bullet points helps to clearly distinguish between different aspects of the proposed initiatives. Furthermore, the response provides a concise summary of the key elements discussed, which adds to the overall coherence and readability of the text. The flow of ideas is smooth and logically progresses from one point to another, showcasing a high level of internal consistency.

While there are no explicitly connected sentences or clear temporal or causal markers, the narrative maintains a consistent focus on the core issue and does not deviate from the central theme. The structure and flow of the text contribute to the summary's clarity and coherence, despite the absence of explicit markers.

In conclusion, while the summary is technically coherent, the absence of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that could enhance the explicit coherence between ideas and sentences, means it falls slightly short of a perfect score. However, the overall clarity, structure, and flow of the text make it highly informative and easily comprehensible. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"While the response touches upon key points in the instruction, it falls short in terms of coherence and depth. The sentences are largely disconnected from one another, making the overall narrative disjointed. The use of short, declarative sentences without any transitions or connectors results in a summary that lacks the flow and continuity of a coherent narrative. The response provides fragmented insights into the disagreement between Spain and Portugal over the construction of a rail line, but it fails to create a comprehensive and cohesive story. There is an absence of any structural devices, such as temporal connectors or discourse markers, that would link the ideas together and provide context to the reader. As a result, the reader may struggle to follow the story or to understand the interconnectedness of the various points being made. The response also does not make any effort to explain the rationale behind the conflicting priorities of Spain and Portugal. This lack of explanation and the absence of explicit coherence markers in the response lead to a summary that does not meet the highest standards of coherence as outlined in the score rubric. Thus, based on the evaluation criteria provided in the score rubric, the response would receive a score of 1, indicating a very low level of coherence in the summary. 
[RESULT] 1",1
gpt5-tldr,"The summary provided effectively outlines the key events surrounding the asasinato of Samuel Luiz and the subsequent concentration protests by Avante LGTBI+. It does a commendable job of maintaining coherence throughout, creating a structured narrative that progresses from the incident itself to the ongoing legal process and the consequent national outcry. There is a clear cause-and-effect relationship between sentences, which allows the reader to follow along without any confusion or abrupt transitions. Each sentence contributes meaningfully to the overall message of the summary, thus establishing explicit coherence. The integration of the various events, from the initial attack to the ongoing investigation and the eventual rallying, indicates a strong understanding of the material presented and its relevance to the context. This level of coherence and contextual relevance is in line with the expectations for a score of 5. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric focused on coherence and flow of ideas, the summary is well-crafted, effectively conveys the necessary information, and presents a seamless narrative progression.

gpt5-tldr,"The response effectively condenses the given instruction and presents a coherent and succinct summary of the events and possibilities involved in the American presidential election. It starts with the current state of affairs, highlighting the roles of Michigan and Wisconsin in the current race. It then moves on to explain the significant margin that Biden holds over Trump. The response also touches upon the remaining states where the vote count has not yet been finalized, pointing out the potential impact of these states.

Moreover, the response addresses the situation where Trump has initiated legal challenges, which might affect the outcome of the election. This highlights the uncertainty and contention that characterizes the election process. 

In terms of coherence, the response maintains a logical progression of ideas, starting with the current standings and concluding with the factors that could influence the election result. The use of temporal phrases such as ""Biden avanza cara"" and ""Mentres Biden semella ter máis opciónes"" help to maintain the temporal flow of events.

Although there are no explicit connectors such as temporal markers or discourse markers, the response provides a clear and cohesive account of the election situation, satisfying the requirements of the score rubric. The response thus achieves a level of coherence that is higher than that of a simple list of events, without compromising the clarity or the overall flow of the narrative.

Considering all these aspects, it can be concluded that the response exhibits a good level of coherence, making it an effective summary of the ongoing American presidential election. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response effectively encapsulates the main points of the event, providing a brief but comprehensive overview of the Cluster TIC Capital Network. The summary flows smoothly from one sentence to another, with clear links between different pieces of information. However, while the response maintains a logical progression and demonstrates an understanding of the event, it does not explicitly use connectors or discourse markers to enhance the coherence. The summary presents the event in a straightforward manner, but could have further elaborated on the components of the Capital Network and the implications for the participating entities. As such, while the response adequately conveys the key aspects of the event, it falls slightly short in terms of explicit coherence compared to a score 5 response. 

So the overall score is 4, as it presents a well-structured summary, but lacks the explicit use of connectors or discourse markers that would further enhance its coherence. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The summary is organized in a manner that clearly represents the views and accusations made by the CIG against the Consellaría. It presents the situation, stating the allegation of the reduction of units and personnel in the educational system, and the reaction of the CIG calling for the mobilization of the sector. However, while the flow of ideas is coherent, the summary lacks explicit connectors or discourse markers that might have helped in demonstrating the relationship between different points. The flow of ideas is chronological but could benefit from more distinct cues to guide the reader. This slightly undermines the clarity of the narrative, as the summary might be perceived as a series of events rather than a cohesive discourse. Nonetheless, it succeeds in providing a structured summary of the situation, and the sentences follow a logical sequence which maintains the overall coherence. So, considering the rubric criteria, the response is of a higher standard in terms of coherence and organization, and it would score a 4, according to the scoring rubric provided.

gpt5-tldr,"This response effectively summarizes the key events of the reported incident. It presents a clear narrative of the incident, stating the time it happened, the person responsible, and the subsequent actions taken by the authorities and community. The use of sentence-level coherence in this response aligns well with the criteria for a score of 4. There are no explicit temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have been used to create more explicit links between the sentences. However, the events are presented in a logical order, with each sentence building upon the previous one. This logical progression of ideas creates an implicit coherence, allowing the reader to follow the narrative without confusion. Additionally, the response incorporates the reactions of the local community and political parties, which helps to give context to the severity of the incident. Despite this, the lack of explicit coherence in this response prevents it from reaching a score of 5. Therefore, considering the score rubric and the overall quality of the response, it can be concluded that the response deserves a score of 4.

gpt5-tldr,"The summary contains a structured list of events that accurately capture the key aspects of the news item. However, the transition between the events is abrupt, with no use of connectors or discourse markers to link the sentences together. This results in a summary that, while informative, lacks the smooth flow of ideas that would enhance its coherence and engagement. It simply lists the events without adequately illustrating their relationship or the chronological order in which they occurred. For example, it mentions the detection of the two different envelopes with bullets but fails to explicitly establish their connection or the context in which they were found. This lack of explicit connectivity in the summary prevents it from achieving a higher score based on the score rubric. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response presents the narrative in a coherent manner, effectively conveying the sequence of events leading up to and including the incident of violence. There are clear transitions between the descriptions of the events and the context surrounding them. However, there is no explicit coherence in terms of connectors or discourse markers that explicitly state the relationship between ideas and sentences. The narrative unfolds in a manner that allows for logical progression, but there is room for further enhancements to create stronger connections between the different pieces of information presented. Despite these minor shortcomings, the response is overall well-structured and well-organized, making it easy to follow the unfolding story. 

In conclusion, while the response exhibits implicit coherence, the explicit use of connectors or discourse markers to highlight the relationships between the ideas presented could have been employed to create a more robust and comprehensive narrative. Nonetheless, the content remains coherent, following a logical sequence from one event to another, which aligns with the desired quality of being well-structured and well-organized as per the score rubric. Therefore, the overall quality of the response is good, but with the potential for improvement in terms of explicit coherence.

The summary mentions her personal best, the performances of other athletes, and her ranking in the competition. However, while the information provided is accurate, the response lacks explicit coherence, with no discourse markers or temporal connectors to bind the sentences into a fluid narrative. For example, the response could be improved by including explicit transitions such as 'later', 'afterwards', or 'finally', which would help create a clear chronological sequence of events. The sentences are also presented in a slightly fragmented manner, which detracts from the overall coherence of the response. Nonetheless, the content is structured in a way that shows a logical flow of ideas, thus providing a reasonable degree of coherence.

For instance, the response omits the critical aspects of the difference in internet usage between urban and rural areas of Galicia, and between different age groups. Additionally, it fails to convey the specifics of the decline in the digital divide, the percentage of households with internet access, and the varying rates of internet use across different regions within Galicia. The response lacks temporal connectors and fails to present the information in a logical and sequential manner. Therefore, it does not meet the criteria for explicit coherence as defined in the score rubric. 

In contrast, a score of 5 would require a more comprehensive and cohesive summary that aligns closely with the original text. This summary should offer a thorough analysis of the various factors contributing to the reduction of the digital divide in Galicia, making clear connections between these factors and their implications for internet use. The summary should also incorporate temporal and causal connectors to enhance the flow and understanding of the content. 

In light of these considerations, it is evident that the response provided is not sufficiently well-structured or organized to meet the criteria for a score of 5.

llama3-base,"In assessing the provided response against the score rubric, it's clear that the quality of coherence is notably lacking. Instead of presenting a structured narrative, the response reads as a series of isolated statements, disjointed and lacking contextual connectors. Each sentence appears as a standalone entity, failing to build upon the previous statement to form a cohesive summary.

Additionally, the absence of transitions or logical connectors results in a fragmented account that does not facilitate an understanding of the underlying sequence of events. This response, therefore, does not conform to the requirement for a coherent body of information about a topic.

It's crucial to note that, despite the lack of structure and connectors, the individual sentences do convey relevant information. However, this fact alone does not suffice to meet the criteria of the score rubric. The respondent's task was to weave these pieces of information into a coherent narrative, which they have not accomplished.

Ultimately, the response does not display the necessary qualities of structure and coherence.

The summary does cover the essential elements of the text, such as the criticism of the Consellaría, the figures of reduction, and the stance of the CIG on the matter. However, the flow of ideas in the summary is not as smooth as it could be, and the use of transition phrases or markers that explicitly connect sentences and ideas is limited. For example, the transition between the information about the Consellaría's actions and the CIG's accusation is abrupt, lacking a clear link between the two. Moreover, the summary does not explicitly state the continuity of events or their causal relationship, which would make the summary more coherent. Therefore, while the summary does address the key aspects of the text, its lack of explicit coherence and the occasional break in the narrative flow make it less effective than it could be. 

In terms of coherence, the response manages to maintain an implicit coherence through a sequential listing of the Consellaría's actions, the CIG's position, and the future implications. However, the absence of discourse markers or temporal connectors results in a somewhat fragmented summary. It is clear that a more nuanced approach to the organization of ideas and the inclusion of textual resources like temporal connectors or discourse markers would improve the coherence of the summary. The summary also misses out on fully exploring the connections between the different statements and facts presented in the text, resulting in a narrative that feels slightly disjointed. 

The evaluation of the score rubric reveals that the response exhibits some level of coherence but lacks the explicit connections and textual resources that would give it a higher score. Therefore, while the summary does capture the essence of the given text, its coherence could be enhanced through the use of appropriate language tools and structural organization to more effectively convey the sequence of events and the interconnectedness of the ideas presented.

llama3-base,"The response provides a clear and organized summary of the text. However, it lacks explicit coherence, which could have been achieved by the use of textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers. For instance, phrases like ""Como a corrente,"" or ""Se dice que"" could have been used to create a more cohesive and flowing narrative. Instead, the response reads more like a list of facts rather than a well-structured summary. Despite this, the sentences do follow a temporal order, which helps in understanding the sequence of events. In terms of coherence, the summary contains implicit coherence but not explicit. It is able to convey the necessary information about the incident and its aftermath but does not use explicit tools to enhance the reader's understanding of the interconnections between different parts of the narrative. This makes the summary less engaging and slightly harder to follow compared to a summary with explicit coherence. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response contains a clear narrative of events that occurred over the past few days, making it coherent and connected. However, there is a lack of explicit markers to signify the chronological order of the events or to delineate the progression of the summary. The response flows well, but the reader may not have a strong sense of the sequence of events and the interconnection between them. The coherence is therefore implicit rather than explicit. It should be noted that while the summary is well-organized and contains all relevant information, it falls short of containing textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the explicit coherence of the text. Hence, the response aligns more closely with the score 4 description in the rubric, which recognizes the implicit coherence within the summary but does not highlight the absence of explicit connectors. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response successfully summarizes the given text, though it does not explicitly use temporal connectors or discourse markers. There is an implied order in which the events occurred. However, the summary could be further improved by explicitly linking the sentences to build a more coherent narrative, such as using ""then"" or ""after"" to establish a clear sequence of events. The response does a good job of summarizing key points, but the lack of explicit connectors reduces its overall coherence. So, based on the score rubric, the response has implicit coherence and thus scores 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"This response, although concise, lacks the depth and detail necessary for a coherent summary. The summary does not contain any temporal connectors or discourse markers that would link the events together. It merely states the accomplishment of Ana Peleteiro without elaborating on the circumstances that led to her winning a bronze medal in the women's triple jump at the Tokyo Olympics. The absence of these elements results in a summary that fails to build upon the information provided and lacks the necessary flow to be considered well-structured and well-organized. Therefore, based on the score rubric, which focuses on coherence, structure, and organization, this summary is deemed to be insufficient. It does not convey a complete picture of the event or the efforts and triumphs of Ana Peleteiro. The summary does not clearly mark the relationship between ideas and sentences, which is a critical aspect of coherent writing. Thus, while there are no glaring grammatical errors, the summary falls short in providing a comprehensive and connected narrative of Ana Peleteiro's journey to victory. So the overall score is 1.

llama3-5w1h,"The provided response makes a commendable effort in utilizing the 5W1H method to summarize the text. However, there are certain aspects that prevent it from achieving a higher score according to the scoring rubric. While the response does cover all the necessary elements like what, who, when, where, why and how, it falls short in conveying the interconnectedness between these elements. The sentences, although individually structured, lack explicit connectors that would provide the reader with a clear understanding of the causal relationship between the elements described. This lack of explicit connectors leads to a disjointed narrative that could potentially confuse the reader, preventing the response from building a coherent body of information about the topic as per the scoring rubric. Additionally, the absence of transitional phrases that could have been used to better guide the reader through the text results in a summary that, although informative, is not as seamless as it could be. Despite these shortcomings, the response remains structured and relevant, thus meeting the minimum requirements of the 5W1H method. Therefore, the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response utilizes the 5W1H method well, addressing all the components required by the task. However, it does not provide a full narrative flow, which makes it less effective in conveying the information in a seamless manner. While it accurately presents the information, it falls short in terms of explicit coherence, as it lacks the use of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have helped to tie together the sequence of events more explicitly.

The response is well-structured and each point corresponds to a question of the 5W1H method, thus indicating an understanding of the task. It mentions the key points, including the identities of the individuals involved, the timing and location of the incident, and the nature of the investigation. Nonetheless, it does not fully develop each point, which could have helped in creating a more cohesive narrative.

While the summary is coherent to some degree, it does not demonstrate an explicit connection between the points mentioned. The narrative could be improved by adding more explicit transitions to guide the reader through the summary, as this would better showcase the relationship between ideas and sentences.

In summary, the response meets the criteria for a score of 4, as it demonstrates implicit coherence, but it lacks explicit connectors. Therefore, it is recommended that the summary be further improved by adding explicit connectors to strengthen the narrative flow and enhance the overall coherence of the summary. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The provided response has managed to summarize the text using the 5W1H method, as required by the task. However, the flow of information is not as coherent as it could be. For instance, the transitions between the different components of the Festival are not clearly defined. This can make it more challenging for readers to follow the progression of ideas, as there are no explicit linking the ideas together. The use of temporal markers, such as ""Cando"" and ""Por que"", could have been employed more effectively to provide clearer time frames and logical connectors between the points made. In addition, while the response does manage to present the information, the way the ideas are developed within each bullet point is somewhat underwhelming, lacking the detailed explanation that would allow for a deeper understanding of the Festival's aims and activities. These aspects contribute to the fact that while the response does meet the criteria of the task, it does not achieve the highest level of coherence. Hence, it falls short of achieving a score of 5, as it lacks explicit coherence and clear temporal and causal connections between the ideas presented. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"While the provided response is aligned with the 5W1H structure, it fails to provide a comprehensive and coherent summary. The response successfully identifies the source (Galiza) and the key players (Real Academia Galega) and it touches upon the purpose (promoting universal access to the institution's patrimony). However, it does not delve into the what, who, when, where, why, and how of the situation. The lack of detail and depth in the explanation results in a fragmented understanding of the event. Additionally, the response lacks connective elements and a logical progression that are crucial in creating a coherent summary. The use of bullet points does not enhance the coherence or flow of ideas, as the information provided is disjointed and lacks the necessary context. The response also misses the opportunity to highlight specific aspects such as the types of documents available or the benefits of the new web platform. Hence, considering the lack of detailed explanation and absence of explicit connectors, the response falls short in meeting the rubric's standards for coherence. So the overall score is 1.

llama3-5w1h,"This summary is severely lacking in terms of coherence and structure. The response merely reiterates the same information without providing a logical flow or connecting the points made. There is no progression or clear linkage between sentences, and no attempt to organize or analyze the data presented in the original text. The information is redundant and no new insights are provided. This approach makes it difficult for the reader to follow the discussion or understand the various aspects that contribute to the digital divide in Galicia. Furthermore, the repetitive nature of the response suggests a lack of understanding of the complex factors that influence digital access and usage in different regions. Based on these observations, it is clear that this response does not meet the criteria for a well-structured and coherent summary. So the overall score is 1.

llama3-5w1h,"The response is a clear, succinct summary that sticks to the task requirements. It effectively uses the 5W1H method, giving specific information on the 'who' (Jesús Vázquez), 'where' (Lugo e Ourense), 'when' (O pasado xoves), 'why' (to combat rural decline), and 'how' (through the proposed measures). It creates a coherent narrative by linking these elements together, and it employs connectors that reflect a logical sequence of events and considerations. The response also integrates specific examples and goals from the text, such as the call for a reordering of the forest and the introduction of plants of biomass. These details demonstrate a deeper understanding of the original content, thus enhancing the coherence of the summary. Overall, the response shows a high level of alignment with the score rubric's criteria for explicit coherence, making it a comprehensive and connected summary.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provides a clear summary using the 5W1H method, with a focus on the key actors and their positions. It presents a concise list of events, while also connecting these events to reveal the ongoing conflict between the two governments. However, the lack of explicit coherence markers results in a less fluid reading experience. It successfully recounts the historical context, as well as the present-day disagreements, but it does not build upon the ideas presented in a way that would help the reader follow the narrative. Despite these shortcomings, the summary remains coherent and consistent, offering a solid understanding of the complex issue at hand. The absence of explicit coherence is less impactful in this context, due to the strong internal consistency of the presented facts. Therefore, while the response could benefit from incorporating discourse markers or temporal connectors to enhance its coherence, its quality aligns more closely with a score of 4 rather than 5.

llama3-5w1h,"The summary provided does contain some elements of the 5W1H method, such as the identity of the victim, the location of the incident, and the method of the crime. However, it lacks explicit coherence and does not adequately connect the various components of the summary. The sentences appear disjointed, which does not facilitate a clear understanding of the sequence of events. For instance, the method of the crime is mentioned after the location, which could cause confusion about the chronological order of the events. There is also no mention of the purpose behind the victim's death, the social context, or the public reaction, which are critical elements in summarizing such a tragic event. The summary does not follow a coherent flow, and there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to establish a connection between the different aspects of the text. Therefore, based on the score rubric, the summary lacks the explicit coherence necessary to convey a clear and concise summary of the events. So the overall score is 1.

llama3-5w1h,"The provided response has missed key elements of the original text and therefore does not provide a comprehensive summary based on the 5W1H method. The questions of what, who, when, where, why, and how have not been adequately addressed. While the candidate and the country are mentioned, the details of the election process, the timeframe, and the reasons behind the events are omitted. The absence of explicit connectors between sentences makes the information appear fragmented, rather than coherent. There is also no indication of how the events have unfolded over time. Thus, the summary does not exhibit a well-structured and organized body of information as per the DUC quality question. In conclusion, the lack of development in ideas and sentences, as well as the absence of connectors, leads to an incomplete summary of the original text. So the overall score is 1.

llama3-5w1h,"In the provided response, the application of the 5W1H method to summarize the given text has been done effectively. The summary logically follows the ""What, Who, When, Where, Why and How"" method, addressing all aspects required by the instruction. However, the response lacks explicit coherence, as it does not include temporal connectors or discourse markers to delineate the relationship between different ideas and sentences. The summary also does not use transition phrases to enhance the flow of information, making it slightly harder to follow than a summary with these elements. This lack of explicit connectors and the absence of transitions hinder the ability of the reader to understand the relationship between events, which is crucial for maintaining coherence in a summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric focusing on coherence and explicit connections between ideas, the response would receive a score of 4.

llama3-5w1h,"The response effectively uses the 5W1H method to summarize the text, presenting information on what happened, who was involved, when it occurred, where it took place, why it was significant, and how it should be addressed. However, the summary lacks explicit coherence markers that would help readers understand the interconnectedness of the events described. This absence results in a narrative that, while logically organized, could be enhanced by including clear connectors between ideas, such as transitional phrases or discourse markers. Nonetheless, the flow of ideas remains largely implicit, making the summary coherent, but slightly less engaging than it could be with the addition of explicit coherence markers. Therefore, the response earns a score of 4 according to the scoring rubric.

llama3-5w1h,"The summary provided is lacking in terms of structure and coherence. It's presented as a list of disconnected sentences, each containing only one piece of information. There are no temporal connectors or discourse markers to tie the sentences together or indicate a sequence of events. The summary fails to provide a cohesive narrative of the incident, leaving the reader without a clear understanding of what happened, who was involved, and the subsequent reactions and plans of action. This lack of continuity and connection between sentences results in a fragmented and confusing summary, which does not meet the criteria for coherence set out in the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-5w1h,"This response demonstrates a clear understanding of the 5W1H method. It succinctly summarizes the main points of the text without repeating or introducing new information. Each aspect of the text is addressed individually: what happened, who was involved, when the events occurred, where they took place, why they happened, and how they unfolded. The summary builds logically from one point to another, adhering closely to the order and structure of the original text. There are no grammatical errors or omissions in the summary, indicating a high degree of comprehension.

Moreover, the response shows a good use of transition phrases and connectors, which effectively link the different elements of the summary, enhancing its coherence. The narrative flows smoothly from one event to another, facilitating an easy understanding of the content.

While the response is concise, it provides all necessary details without sacrificing clarity. The use of specific names and places adds to the coherence of the summary.

Overall, the response adheres well to the score rubric criteria, particularly in terms of structure and coherence. The summary is organized, logically connected, and free from errors or irrelevant information. It effectively communicates the key points of the original text, making it an excellent example of how to summarize complex information using the 5W1H method.

llama3-5w1h,"The response provided a summary that lacks coherence and structure, as it did not effectively use the 5W1H method. The response was fragmented and disjointed, presenting the information in a list-like format rather than building a narrative. Each sentence seemed isolated and failed to contribute to a comprehensive and connected account of the events. Additionally, the response did not include any temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have helped establish the sequence of events and relate them to one another. This disjointed approach resulted in a summary that lacked clarity and comprehension. Thus, the score of 1 is appropriate as the response failed to create a well-structured and coherent summary about the topic in question.

llama3-5w1h,"This summary successfully employs the 5W1H method, with each 5W element succinctly addressed. It mentions Ana Peleteiro, the event she was a part of (triplo salto feminino), the place where the event took place (Estadio Nacional de Toquio), the reason why she participated (because it was her best performance in a championship), and how she was able to achieve her goal (she broke her personal record in the last salto, surpassing the performance of the Xamaican Rickets). 

However, it falls short in its lack of coherence and explicit connection between ideas, which is critical according to the score rubric. For example, there is no mention of the record Ana broke (14,87 metros), or how this achievement compared to others in the event. The sentences, while individually correct, fail to build a cohesive narrative about the event in question. There is also no mention of how Ana was awarded the bronze medal or of the competition's importance in terms of her personal journey and the first time a Galician athlete reached the Olympic podium. 

Despite this, the response contains all the necessary elements and adheres to the 5W1H method. It just needs to improve on connecting these elements in a coherent manner to reach the highest level of the score rubric. 

So, while it meets the basic requirements of the score rubric, the summary's lack of coherence and explicit connections between ideas and sentences prevents it from receiving a higher score. 

Therefore, based on the score rubric, which places emphasis on coherence and explicit connection between ideas, this summary earns a score of 3. [RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided has a focus on the core elements of the original instruction, but it lacks the depth and detail that the instruction demanded. While it touches upon the demand for a center therapeutic and additional resources for the hospital in Cee, it fails to capture the complexity of the issues faced by the association. The details about the underserved area, the need for a UCI or more specialties, and the criticism of the area's limited health services are omitted, leading to a lack of comprehensive understanding of the issues at hand. Moreover, the response does not effectively utilize any textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers to improve the coherence of the content, which further undermines its effectiveness as a summary. The summary is, therefore, more of a brief overview rather than a detailed, coherent explanation of the problem. This lack of explicit coherence and depth results in a summary that only partially addresses the instruction's requirements. Consequently, the response fails to fully meet the criteria of the score rubric.

llama3-tldr,"This response is a cohesive summary of the events following the asasinato of Jimmy. It connects the details of the arrests, the suspected involvement of the Frente Atlético, and the broader implications for the club and its fans. The narrative flow is maintained with clear references to key facts and developments in the case. However, while the response covers essential elements of the investigation, it does not explicitly use temporal or causal connectors that would enhance the clarity of the progression of events. The response also omits details about the broader political and social context surrounding the asasinato, which could provide additional layers of understanding. Despite these omissions, the response does demonstrate implicit coherence through the logical sequence of events and the connection of ideas. Therefore, the response is strong in terms of coherence, with room for improvement in terms of explicit connectors and contextual information. So the overall score is 4.

llama3-tldr,"This response has not provided a comprehensive summary of the ""Curtocircuíto 2021"" festival. It merely states the event's name and mentions the interdisciplinary program and the presence of different art forms. However, it does not detail the key aspects of the festival, such as the directors involved, the number of films to be screened, the competitive sections, or the various venues. The lack of connectors between the ideas presented, as well as the absence of a clear temporal flow, makes the summary disjointed and less coherent. While there are no significant grammatical errors or incorrect information, the response fails to build a coherent body of information about the festival. It appears to be a collection of isolated statements rather than a structured summary. Hence, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 1, as it falls short in providing a coherent summary with the required structure and connectors.

llama3-tldr,"The given response, while touching upon the main elements of the task, falls short of achieving a higher score due to its limited scope. It only mentions the availability of over 350 volumes since 1906, which, while relevant, lacks depth and detail. There is no mention of the portals accessibility, the facilitation of digital access to content, the direct participation of the RAG president and secretariat, nor the broader impact on the public's access to information. It does not provide an overview of what the users can find on the new platform, nor does it describe how the RAG aims to enhance its offerings. The summary provided is a brief statement of the RAG's new portal, which is not consistent with the level of detail and the variety of aspects addressed in the task. Thus, it does not meet the criteria of creating an explicit coherence between the elements of the task. Therefore, based on the score rubric, it appears that the response could be improved by incorporating more comprehensive information about the new platform, including the kinds of content available, the strategic goals of the RAG, and the experiences of the users.

llama3-tldr,"The provided response does not meet the expectations set forth in the score rubric. It is a disjointed series of sentences without any coherence or clear structure. It lacks temporal or causal connectors, and as a result, it fails to build from one sentence to another to form a cohesive body of information. The sentences appear to be isolated statements rather than part of a larger narrative or analysis. Consequently, the response does not exhibit the desired quality of coherence and organization. The absence of explicit markers or connectors, as stipulated in the score rubric, highlights the fragmented nature of the summary. Therefore, based on the score rubric's emphasis on structure and coherence, this response would be graded as a score 1 due to its lack of internal consistency and coherence.

It lacks explicit coherence, with no temporal connectors or discourse markers present to mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. While there are no grammatical errors or incorrect information, the lack of development in the response causes it to fall short of a coherent body of information about the topic. Therefore, it fails to meet the standard set by the score rubric for coherence and structure. So the overall score is 1.

There is a notable absence of temporal connectors or discourse markers that could have effectively linked the ideas and sentences. However, it does provide a coherent body of information, albeit with an implied rather than explicit coherence, as evidenced by the consistent thematic elements throughout the response. Despite this, it would benefit from more explicit connectors to enhance the coherence of the overall message. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4

However, it lacks the explicit coherence found in the reference response, which not only lists the events but also connects them with temporal markers and shows a progression of information. The summary does not use explicit connectors, which slightly affects the flow of the narrative. It is crucial for a well-structured summary to clearly link the sentences, showing the sequence of events and their interrelationship.

However, it lacks the depth and coherence expected for a summary that would score higher on the rubric. The sentences are indeed connected, with each one building on the previous one to present a sequential narrative. However, the response could be improved by incorporating temporal connectors or discourse markers to enhance the flow and coherence between ideas. There is a sense of continuity, but the summary does not fully exploit the potential to guide the reader through the complex events of the election. For example, it does not clearly indicate that the events described occurred in a specific timeframe or sequence.

It mentions the occurrence of the event and the inclusion of nine selected projects for presentation. However, the response fails to connect the ideas presented and does not provide enough details for each project. This results in a lack of explicit coherence between the different aspects of the event. Furthermore, the response lacks textual resources such as temporal connectors or discourse markers that would help in building a coherent body of information. Although the response does mention the selection of nine projects, it does not elaborate on them or indicate their relevance to the context of the event.

However, the response could benefit from incorporating explicit coherence markers to delineate the relationship between ideas and sentences. The flow of information, while coherent, could be enhanced with the use of transitional phrases or similar devices. Therefore, according to the score rubric, which values explicit coherence, the response would receive a score of 4.

llama3-tldr,"While the summary provides an overview of the incident in question, it lacks a clear and structured narrative. The sentences seem disjointed, presenting facts rather than forming a coherent storyline. For instance, the summary jumps from describing the crime scene to the repercussions of the incident without providing context or transitions. This makes it difficult to follow the sequence of events. Additionally, there are no connectors used to link the ideas presented in the summary, which further hinders the overall coherence of the narrative. The summary also lacks depth in explaining the reactions of the community and the political entities involved. In conclusion, the summary, although factually correct, does not meet the standards set for coherence and structure, as it fails to provide a connected and chronologically ordered account of the events.

It doesn't mention the key events in a clear sequence, nor does it elaborate on the significance of the incident, which was an important aspect of the original text. The absence of explicit connectors or discourse markers also limits the response's ability to establish a clear narrative. The response does provide a basic summary, but it fails to capture the full scope of the situation, and thus does not fully meet the criteria for coherence.

llama3-tldr,"The response provided is a straightforward summary of Ana Peleteiro's achievement at the Olympics. It correctly mentions that she won the bronze medal in the triple jump. However, it lacks the depth and detail found in a higher-scoring summary. It does not elaborate on Peleteiro's personal best record, the competitive level at which she achieved her feat, or the broader implications of her achievement. The response also fails to mention the impact of her record-breaking performance or the comparative standing against other competitors. As such, while the response is coherent, it falls short of the more nuanced and comprehensive detailing required by the score rubric. 

The response would be improved by adding more details about Peleteiro's performance, such as the exact record she set, who she was compared to, and how her performance was significant in the context of the competition. Additionally, the use of explicit connectors or discourse markers could have provided a more organized and comprehensive summary, as indicated by the score rubric. 

In conclusion, the response adequately conveys the basic facts of Ana Peleteiro's performance but does not fully meet the criteria of the score rubric for coherence and detail. This analysis suggests that a higher score would require a more elaborate and detailed account of the event, including explicit connections between different aspects of Peleteiro's achievement.
