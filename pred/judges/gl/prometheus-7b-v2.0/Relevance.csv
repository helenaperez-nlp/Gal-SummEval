In terms of the score rubric, the summary avoids redundancy and stays on topic. It is free from subjective opinions and metalinguistic phrases, thus maintaining the objectivity required for a good summary.

salamandra-base,"The summary provides a clear overview of the events following the asassinato of Jimmy. It includes important details like the involvement of the Frente Atlético, the number of detained individuals, and the potential military and police connections. The summary also touches on the role of the police in their investigation and hints at the development of the investigation over time. However, it lacks depth in discussing the larger implications of these events, such as the fracturing of the Deportivo fan base or the broader societal response. Additionally, while the summary does provide some details about the identities of the individuals involved, it could have further elaborated on the specific actions and relationships that led to the asassinato. This missing information leaves the summary feeling somewhat incomplete, despite the mostly relevant information provided. As a result, the summary could have been improved by providing more context about the parties involved and the motivations behind their actions. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"The provided response shows an understanding of the source text's key points. It includes essential details such as the festival's dates, the presence of renowned figures like Yann González, and the inclusion of a range of artistic disciplines. However, it does not adequately cover all the details from the original text. For instance, the response does not mention the specific location of the festival events or the names of the festival's two main categories. Additionally, it fails to elaborate on the variety of activities or the specific members of the jury. Furthermore, while the summary maintains relevance, it does not capture the same depth as the original text. Therefore, despite its brevity and relevance, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary, resulting in a lack of richness in detail. Based on these aspects, the response aligns more closely with the score rubric's requirements for a score of 3. The summary contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, reflecting the necessity for additional detail to fully represent the source text. 
[RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-base,"In evaluating the summary, it's evident that the response manages to incorporate most of the relevant information presented in the original text. It correctly highlights the purpose of the Real Academia Galega's new web platform, which is aimed at facilitating access to the institution's extensive collection of publications. It also rightly mentions the types of content that can be accessed through the new platform, such as academic journals, monographs, and historical documents like speeches by notable figures and papers on linguistic studies. However, the response could have included additional details, such as the number of volumes available and the significance of the platform in the context of the Public Knowledge Project. Furthermore, the mention of the platform's ability to facilitate the management of academic texts, from submission to final publication, adds to its comprehensiveness. The response avoids any unnecessary repetitions or redundancies, and it refrains from introducing subjective opinions, adhering closely to the score rubric's criteria for relevance and conciseness. Therefore, the response is largely effective in providing a succinct yet informative summary of the original text. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"The summary effectively condenses the key points of the original text, addressing the reduction in the digital divide, the variations within Galicia based on urban/rural areas and age groups, and the comparison with Spain. However, there are certain aspects that are not addressed in the summary. For instance, the summary fails to mention the trends in the growth rate of Internet usage in Galicia compared to the state, or the specific changes in the percentage of households with internet connection in Galicia. Additionally, while it correctly notes the differences in internet usage among urban and rural Galicia, it does not delve into the implications of these differences or their impact on the overall digital divide. These omissions lead to a loss of some crucial information from the source text, making the summary slightly less comprehensive than it could be. Therefore, while the summary is largely accurate and relevant, it falls short in providing a complete picture of the original text. Thus, according to the score rubric, which values the inclusion of all relevant information without excess or irrelevant information, the summary achieves a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"The given response contains all the relevant information from the original text and does not introduce any irrelevant content. It presents a succinct summary that captures the key points of the text, namely the presentations of Galicia Baleira in Lugo and Ourense, the role of the lucense Jesús Vázquez and Ourense's Manuel Mosquera, the set of 23 measures to counter rural depopulation, and the challenges faced by the rural areas. Additionally, the response touches upon important aspects such as public services, infrastructure improvements, and economic development, thereby addressing the multifaceted nature of the issues at hand. The lack of subjective opinions and the direct presentation of the main points in the text demonstrate a strong alignment with the score rubric's criteria. The response successfully avoids unnecessary details and redundancies, which is in line with the score rubric's requirement for relevance. Therefore, based on the given rubric, the response is accurately judged as containing only important information from the source document. 
[RESULT] 5",5
salamandra-base,"Based on the provided summary and the instruction, it's clear that the summary has failed to capture the essential details of the original text. The summary mentioned about the conexion atlántica and the 876 million euro funding but did not address the key points such as the specific objections of the Spanish government, the proposal for 2021 orzamentos, the study informativo, and the preferred project of the Portuguese government. Furthermore, the summary also included irrelevant information, such as the context of the event during which the statements were made. These points reflect the original text's content, which was expected in the summary. The summary's failure to focus on these critical elements leads to its inaccuracy and irrelevance, resulting in a score of 1 according to the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-base,"The response presents a condensed version of the original text, focusing on key points such as the date of the concentrations, the place of Samuel Luiz's death, and the presence of various organizations promoting the event. However, it lacks some essential details like the 3-hour time frame from the murder to when Samuel Luiz was rushed to the hospital, and the fact that he was an auxiliary nurse. Additionally, while it mentions that there were over 50 confirmed concentrations, it doesn't provide a complete list of all the places where these events will take place, thus missing some crucial information. Given the importance of including all significant details from the source text, this response only contains mostly relevant information, failing to cover all the pertinent details about the case. Therefore, according to the score rubric, the summary contains mostly relevant information, but it could have been more comprehensive. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"This response contains some elements that are pertinent to the original text. It mentions the standstill in the election and the closeness in several states, which are key points in the context of the ongoing U.S. presidential election. However, it includes redundant information such as the fact that both candidates are not decided yet and that Trump has filed legal demands, which do not add new information to the summary. Additionally, it presents a personal opinion stating ""tudo apunta a que esta noite imos saber quen será o próximo inquilino da Casa Branca,"" which diverges from the requirement of avoiding subjective opinions that are not part of the original text. The response lacks specific details about the election results and the contested states, which are essential to the summary. Therefore, it is important to include these details to maintain relevance. The focus on a few crucial points while avoiding unnecessary information is key to achieving a higher score. 
[RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-base,"The provided response is solely focused on the attendees of the Cluster TIC Capital Network event. It lists the various financial institutions and organizations that were present, which, while informative about the event's scale and scope, does not encapsulate the essence of the event or its objectives as presented in the source text. This lack of alignment with the critical aspects of the event such as the identification of business opportunities, negotiation of investment deals, and the introduction of innovative projects leads to a considerable amount of irrelevant information being included. Therefore, according to the rubric's focus on relevance, this response does not fulfill the criteria as it does not include the important information from the source document and contains redundancies. As a result, it scores lower than the desired score. 
[RESULT] 2",2
salamandra-base,"The summary provided in this response does indeed touch upon some relevant points from the original text, including the reduction of unities and the possibility of alternative solutions for individual cases. However, it fails to capture the essence of the original text in several respects. For example, the response doesn't mention the exact numbers of eliminated and created units, nor does it clearly communicate the accusations against the Consellaría de Cultura, Educación e Universidade of misrepresenting the situation and attempting to deceive the public. Furthermore, the response does not effectively address the main concerns of the community, such as the limited consideration of the needs of students and teachers during the pandemic, nor does it accurately convey the viewpoint of the central sindical chamado CIG. The response is therefore a mix of relevant and irrelevant information and lacks the necessary detail and accuracy to fully summarize the original text. As such, it does not meet the expectations set forth in the score rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-base,"The response provided includes significant information that aligns with the context of the original text. It focuses on the aggravated assault on Montse López, the suspect, Javier M., and the subsequent actions by the authorities. Furthermore, it touches on the public denunciation and the various protests organized in support of the victim. However, the response could have been more precise by mentioning the police forces' role and the explicit mention of the incident occurring in Vimianzo. It also could have included more details about the concentration held in Vimianzo, which were significant. While it does a good job summarizing the main points, there are areas that could be elaborated upon for a more comprehensive understanding. In this regard, it strikes a balance between relevance and omission of some details that would have provided a more complete picture of the incident and the reactions to it. Overall, the response effectively captures the essence of the event, though it could benefit from a more detailed description of the events and reactions. So the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"The response provided is largely relevant to the original text. It summarizes the key points, such as the president's comment on not allowing oneself to be threatened. However, the response fails to mention the detailed events like the interception of the packages and the identification of the recipient as Isabel Díaz Ayuso. It also does not refer to the threats received by both Ayuso and Gámez. This leaves out significant portions of the original text, which would help the reader understand the full scope of the situation. Therefore, while the response is mostly relevant, it lacks the comprehensiveness expected of a summary. The omission of these details and the absence of any metalinguistic phrase results in the summary losing some of its effectiveness. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-base,"This response provides a simplified summary of the given text, but it omits some critical details that would make the summary more complete. For instance, it fails to mention the age of the victim, the exact location where the aggression took place, and the phrase ""querían vender o monte por catro perras."" Additionally, the response does not touch upon the reasons behind the support for the project of Porto Cabral or the various allegations made by the victim and others. Furthermore, it doesn't mention the subsequent actions by the victim or the outcome of the incident. These omissions make the summary less comprehensive than it could be, which leads to a loss of important context provided by the original text. Based on these observations, it can be concluded that while the response includes some relevant information, it is not as detailed or accurate as it could be. This results in a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, which is why it would receive a score of 3 according to the provided rubric. 
[RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-base,"The response encapsulates the significant aspects of Ana Peleteiro's performance at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics. It highlights her achievement of a bronze medal in the women's triple jump, her status as the first Galician to enter the Olympic medalists' list, and her individual accomplishment of achieving a personal best in her fourth attempt, which earned her the bronze medal. Furthermore, the response does a good job at summarizing the events leading to the bronze medal, namely the attempt to break her personal record and the subsequent placement. However, it slightly misses the mention of the Brazilian athlete, Yulimar Rojas, and her position as the one Peleteiro was supered by. Nonetheless, the omission of these details does not significantly detract from the overall relevance of the summary. Therefore, the response includes relevant information from the original text and does not contain redundancies or excess information. Thus, according to the score rubric, it effectively fulfills the criteria for a score of 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provides a summary of the text, adhering to the 5W1H method, but does not fully capture the scope and complexity of the original message. While it addresses what was asked for, who the association is, and where the association is, it fails to provide a detailed explanation of the context, such as the specific issues faced by the area, the timeline of events, and the extent of the problems. Moreover, it doesn't mention the significant aspects like the specific demands of the association, the number of localities and their combined population, and the inadequacy of current services, which were crucial parts of the original text. Additionally, the response could benefit from a more structured and detailed approach to make it more comprehensive and informative. Therefore, based on the score rubric, which emphasizes the relevance of information in the summary, the response does not fully meet these criteria. It lacks the depth and specificity of the original message, making it less effective in conveying the key points. Hence, it scores a 3, as it contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, but it does not fully represent the breadth and detail of the original document. 
[RESULT] 3",3
salamandra-5w1h,"This summary captures the main points from the text, addressing the 5W1H method by discussing the What (a violent incident), Who (the individuals involved), When (the time period), Where (Madrid and other locations), Why (the reasons for the operation), and How (the methods used in the operation). However, it doesn't elaborate on these aspects in a way that provides a comprehensive understanding of the situation. It also fails to mention the second phase of the operation and the controversy surrounding the ownership of the Riazor Blues. Despite this, the response avoids irrelevant information and maintains a focus on the key events described in the original text. Consequently, the summary is mostly relevant, reflecting a good grasp of the source material while providing a condensed version of the content. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provides a clear and concise summary of the Festival International de Cine. However, the response could have been more effective if it had included some additional details that would have provided a more comprehensive understanding of the festival's scope. For instance, it does not mention the division of the Seção Oficial into two categories, which is a key detail about the structure of the event. Furthermore, the inclusion of subjective opinions about the festival's goal and the nature of its program seems slightly off-topic considering the task is to summarize the text and not to provide personal views. Despite these shortcomings, the response does succeed in capturing most of the important elements from the original text and presents them in a structured manner, making it mostly relevant. The response adheres to the 5W1H method, covering what, who, when, where, why, and how, which is commendable. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provided fails to effectively utilize the 5W1H method. It merely restates the same information several times without providing new insights or information. The summary lacks depth and does not present a concise summary of the original text. Important aspects like the significant number of volumes available, the specific content that can be accessed, and the contributions of various members of the academic institution are either repeated in different forms or omitted entirely. This results in a summary that is largely redundant and does not add much value to the reader. Hence, based on the score rubric's criteria for relevance and the elimination of redundancies and excess information, the response falls short of expectations. Therefore, the score is 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provides a basic overview of the text using the 5W1H method but fails to capture the essence of the original text. The summary includes the date of the information release and mentions the source (OSIMGA), but it does not cover the range of important points discussed in the text. It lacks details on the trends and disparities within Galicia, such as the differences in internet usage across different regions and age groups. The response misses key elements, like the rate of growth in internet usage and the specifics about the closure of the digital gap. The response also omits the comparison between Galicia and the rest of Spain and the implications for e-commerce. In contrast, the reference response covers all these aspects in detail. Hence, the summary in the response is incomplete and less relevant than the reference summary. It could be improved by including more specific and significant information about the current status and trends of internet usage in Galicia. So the overall score is 2. [RESULT] 2",2
salamandra-5w1h,"This summary includes a lot of pertinent details from the text provided. It addresses the 5W1H method, including what Galicia Baleira is, who its leaders are, and what its goals are. It provides an overview of the issues discussed and outlines some of the specific actions proposed by the organization.

However, there are parts where the summary could be improved. The response does not fully address the when and where aspects of the 5W1H method. While it mentions that the platform was created recently in Lugo and Ourense, it fails to convey a sense of urgency or immediacy regarding when these changes need to happen. Moreover, it does not specify the contexts or locations in which these actions would be undertaken.

In addition, the summary could benefit from more in-depth analysis of the issues presented. For instance, it could provide more information about the challenges faced by the rural areas and the complexities of implementing the proposed solutions.

Finally, it would be beneficial to include more nuanced perspectives and to avoid simplifying the situation, as is done in the summary. By acknowledging the complexity and multifaceted nature of the rural-urban divide, the summary would better reflect the intricate dynamics at play.

Overall, the summary contains mostly relevant information, but there are areas where it could be enhanced to provide a more complete and detailed picture of Galicia Baleira's mission and objectives. So the score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provides a summary that incorporates mostly relevant information, but it does contain a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. The inclusion of the additional investment of 768 million euros for the new intermodal station of Vigo, along with the planned timeline for various project phases, adds valuable context to the overall summary. However, the response lacks depth in exploring the reasons behind the government's opposition to the project, and it does not capture the full extent of the disagreement between the Spanish and Portuguese governments. Moreover, the response omits key details such as the specific difficulties raised by the Portuguese government and the role of the executives involved in the decision-making process. These omissions result in a summary that is incomplete and could be improved by including more comprehensive information regarding the political stances of the parties involved. Nevertheless, despite these shortcomings, the summary still presents a coherent overview of the major points in the original text. The response effectively encapsulates the primary concerns, such as the disputed connection between Madrid and Lisboa, and it highlights the importance of the project to both parties. Hence, while the response falls slightly short of providing a fully comprehensive summary, it still manages to convey the core issues and perspectives effectively. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provided contains important information that aligns with the original text, fulfilling the requirement to use the 5W1H method to summarize the content. It includes the essential elements such as who is affected (friends and family of Samuel Luiz), the location of the event (Coruña), the time of the incident (the night of the 3 de xullo), the reason behind the protests (denunciation of a possible LGTBfóbico crime), and the details of the current state of the investigation (the secrecy of the summary and the involvement of Avante LGTBI+). However, the summary could have been more comprehensive by adding specific details such as the age of Samuel Luiz, the exact location of the crime (Hotel Riazor), and the time at which the crime occurred (minutes after the 3 hour mark of the madrugada). Furthermore, it lacks information on the wide range of locations where the concentrations are taking place, which is crucial to fully understand the scope of the mobilization. This omission results in a summary that, while relevant, is less complete than the original text. Therefore, it would receive a score of 4 because it contains mostly relevant information but could benefit from more detailed and comprehensive information.

salamandra-5w1h,"The provided summary does not effectively utilize the 5W1H method to summarize the original text. While the summary does mention the key figures (Donald Trump and Joe Biden) and touches upon the where (Estados Unidos) and the when (this martes), it fails to address the what, why, and how fully. There is a lack of clarity on the current state of the presidential election, no specifics regarding the final results or the exact impact of each state's outcome. The summary also introduces irrelevant information regarding the division within Trump's party and the nature of the legal demands initiated by Trump. This strays from the requirement to summarize the text using the 5W1H method and focuses on aspects that are not part of the original text, thus fulfilling neither the original instruction nor the requirements outlined in the score rubric.

The response also gives an overview of the type of projects that were presented, which helps in understanding the nature of the forum and its purpose. Furthermore, it successfully communicates the main points of the event without any superfluous or irrelevant information. The respondent has avoided the inclusion of subjective opinions and has stuck to factual statements from the original text, making the summary objective and focused.

So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
salamandra-5w1h,"The response provided includes key elements of the given text, however, it is a simplified version that lacks the depth and details found in the original source. For example, it fails to capture the full scope of the conflict between the consellaría and the CIG. It does mention the reduction of units and professionals, but it doesn't convey the reasons behind these reductions or the emotional weight carried by the educational community. Moreover, it omits the historical context, such as the recent impact of the pandemic, which is crucial in understanding the full gravity of the situation. The summary is also presented in a more subjective manner, which might not fully reflect the original text's perspective. These aspects make the response less effective as a summary of the source text. The response could have been improved by including more specific details from the original text, particularly about the pending reductions, the implications on the teaching force, and the actions that both sides plan to take. Furthermore, the summarization could have been more focused on the key points of the original text, reducing the amount of general statements and emphasizing the critical issues at hand. Therefore, while the response does cover some relevant information, it is limited in its relevance and depth, resulting in a summary that only partially captures the essence of the source text.

salamandra-5w1h,"The provided summary focuses on the personalities and entities mentioned in the text. It lists names, such as Javier M., Montse López, and specific roles, like the alcalde of Vimianzo and the party Compromiso por Galicia, without connecting them to the context of the incident or the subsequent actions and reactions. This approach results in a list of names without a cohesive narrative or clear context, which does not fully adhere to the 5W1H method that requires a clear summary incorporating all the key elements of the event. While the summary correctly identifies all the important entities mentioned in the text, it does not provide a complete picture of the incident and its aftermath. Therefore, while the response is accurate in terms of the names and roles mentioned, it lacks the necessary context and narrative to effectively summarize the events as instructed. Hence, based on the score rubric, the response does not adequately summarize the text using the 5W1H method. So the overall score is 1.

salamandra-5w1h,"The summary provided in this response effectively employs the 5W1H method to encapsulate the critical details from the original text. The summary delivers the who (Isabel Díaz Ayuso), what (a carta with bullets), when (last day of the week), where (Barcelona and Madrid), why (to avoid reaching the president's office), and how (interception by Correos). The information presented is entirely relevant and free of redundancy or unnecessary elaboration. This adherence to the scoring rubric criteria ensures that the summary is concise, focused on the essential aspects of the narrative, and maintains objectivity. It does not contain subjective opinions, adhering to the requirement of the task. Therefore, based on the rubric, this summary achieves a score of 5.

It adheres to the method of summarization known as the 5W1H, focusing on the key aspects of the incident: who was involved, when the event occurred, where the incident happened, why the event happened, and how the aggravation unfolded. 

However, the summary lacks some of the details that are present in the original text. For instance, the summary fails to mention that the assailants were members of the campaign supporting Porto Cabral, and does not specify that the attack took place during a public event related to the campaign. Additionally, the summary does not mention the substantial number of messages of support that Irene received after the incident. 

The summary is relevant and directly addresses the prompt, but there are missing pieces of information which reduce its effectiveness as a comprehensive summary. Therefore, although the summary includes mostly relevant information, it does not fully capture all aspects of the incident. This leads to a slightly less informative summary than what could be achieved by incorporating the additional details from the original text. 

In light of these observations, the summary is on the right track but could benefit from further refinement to include all critical elements of the original text. Hence, the overall score is 4.

Moreover, the reference to her being the first Galician to win a medal in the Olympics is also missing. The mention of the Estadio Nacional de Toquio is too brief and doesn't convey the significance of this achievement. The sentence, ""Espero que che sirva de,"" is also not relevant to the summary. While the summary does not contain excess information, it does not include all the relevant details, and the additional irrelevant information makes it less than optimal. Therefore, according to the score rubric, it has a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, but still manages to provide a general overview of the main events and achievements of Ana Peleteiro.

The response does not reflect the context of the Costa da Morte, nor does it acknowledge the specific timeframe of the demand. While the response contains mostly relevant information, it lacks the depth and contextual understanding of the original text.

It highlights the key points of the investigation and arrests following the death of ""Jimmy"", an ultra of the Deportivo, and the link between these individuals and Frente Atlético.

However, the summary could have included more details about the aftermath of the operation, such as the commentary on the operation's second phase, the reporting by the Cadena Ser, and the broader impact on the club, the authorities, and the public. It also misses some of the crucial elements like the version of events, the accusations, and the details of the individuals involved in the police operation. These omissions make the summary less comprehensive than it could be.

Furthermore, the summary has been adjusted to better fit the given instruction. The language used in the summary is more focused on the investigation, the arrests, and the context of the violent event, which aligns well with the original text. It avoids subjective opinions and metalinguistic phrases, and focuses on the facts and events, which is the aim as per the score rubric.

However, the response lacks some details that would enhance its relevance, such as the specific roles of the jury members, the exact time frame for the festival, and the division into two categories within the official section. These omissions result in a summary that, while mostly relevant, does not provide a comprehensive overview of the event.

salamandra-tldr,"This response manages to capture the essence of the disagreement between the Spanish and Portuguese governments concerning the development of a high-speed rail line between Lisbon and Vigo. The key aspects of the disagreement are accurately summarized, including the Spanish government's lack of interest in the project, the pressure placed on the Portuguese government, and the eventual agreement reached during the Iberian Summit. However, the summary does not provide the depth of detail found in the original text, such as specific instances of the disagreement, the figures of cost and time for the project, and the broader context of international relations. As such, while the response is concise and relevant, it does not fully encompass all important information from the source document. It also misses some subtle nuances that could provide additional insight into the situation, such as the cultural and economic ties between the two countries. Therefore, the response scores a 4 as it contains mostly relevant information. [RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"The response provided includes a brief summary of the asasinato of Samuel Luiz and its context. However, it lacks the necessary detail and fails to mention key elements such as the declaration of secrecy by the judicial authority, the specific locations of planned protests across multiple cities in Galicia, and the broader issue of homophobia and hate crimes. It is focused solely on the main event of the murder, which limits its relevance to the full scope of the situation described in the instruction. Furthermore, it includes redundant and superfluous information like hashtags, which do not add value to the summary and make it harder to grasp the essential points. The absence of the investigation status, expected future events, and specific details of the incident make the response less informative than necessary. Hence, based on the score rubric that emphasizes relevance and the exclusion of extraneous content, this response would receive a score of 2, as it contains a significant amount of irrelevant information. 
[RESULT] 2",2
salamandra-tldr,"This summary accurately captures the most significant details from the given instruction. It highlights the key elements, such as the current vote counts, the importance of the states where the count is still ongoing, and the ongoing legal challenges. It also succinctly outlines the key issues at hand and the implications of each state's outcome. However, the summary could have been more concise in delivering the same amount of essential information, particularly when addressing the legal disputes. Additionally, there are some slight redundancies that do not add substantial value to the summary. Despite these minor shortcomings, the summary is largely effective in providing a clear and informative overview of the situation. Therefore, based on the score rubric's emphasis on relevance and conciseness, this summary is strong and aligns well with the criteria of providing a clear and informative overview. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"The response provided a concise summary of the event, effectively capturing the essence of the quinto Clúster TIC Capital Network in Compostela. It mentioned key details such as the selection of proxectos, the total investment required, and the various sectors represented by these projects. The inclusion of specific projects like Cardi@ngel, ParkApp, and Situm demonstrated a clear understanding of the topics discussed during the event. However, while it included the relevant information, it could have elaborated slightly more on the nature and benefits of each project to give readers a better understanding of why these projects might be of interest to investors. Nonetheless, it managed to communicate the core message without unnecessary fluff, making it a good summary overall. So the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"This summary effectively captures the essence of the controversy surrounding the reduction of 109 unidades escolares and 150 professores in Galicia. It also touches upon the issue of reduced staffing and the central syndical nationalist CIG's accusation of ""xogar"" figures for the upcoming curriculum. Furthermore, the summary reflects the stance of the Sindicato Nacional de Trabajadores da Enseñanza (CNTE), its critique of the government, and the call for mobilization. However, the summary could have been improved by including more specific details about the cuts to educational staffing and the potential impact on students, as this is a key concern raised by the CIG. The summary, while mostly accurate, also falls short of capturing the full scope of the political debate around these cuts and their implications for the educational system in Galicia. The summary includes most of the relevant content, but a more thorough and nuanced understanding of the situation could enhance its effectiveness. The absence of the phrases ""Here is the summary:"" and any form of subjective opinion further aligns the summary with the requirements of the score rubric. Therefore, the summary would be scored as a 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
salamandra-tldr,"This response captures the essence of the given event but fails to provide specific details that are essential to the story, resulting in a loss of context and relevance. For instance, the name of the woman who was attacked, Montse López, is missing, and there is no mention of the specific location of the crime, which is the concello of Vimianzo. Additionally, the summary contains repetitive elements such as the mention of protest events multiple times without providing additional relevant details. The lack of specificity and the repetition of generic elements like 'protests', 'measures against violence', and 'condenation of the attack' indicate a superficial understanding of the source material. Therefore, based on the score rubric which prioritizes relevance and inclusion of important information from the source document, the response falls short in providing a concise yet comprehensive summary of the incident. So the overall score is 2. 
[RESULT] 2",2
salamandra-tldr,"While the response does capture some of the crucial details from the original text, it misses out on several key elements. It fails to mention the exact locations of the interceptions—Barcelona and Madrid—and does not mention that the cartas were supposedly directed to two different figures. Furthermore, it omits any reference to the personalities involved, which is a significant aspect of the story as it involves figures of high political relevance. The absence of these details makes the summary seem less comprehensive than it could be. On the other hand, the response does avoid any redundancy or excess information, thus adhering to the score rubric in terms of the information being presented. Additionally, the response does not include any subjective opinion or metalinguistic phrases, ensuring that the content remains objective and factually accurate. In light of the above considerations, the summary provided contains mostly relevant information, which aligns with the scoring criteria of the score rubric.

salamandra-tldr,"The summary effectively distills the critical elements of the case against the macrocentro Porto Cabral. It accurately depicts the incident of the aggresion against a local resident and the subsequent involvement of the police. The response is concise, focusing on the core aspects of the story: the location, the characters, and the motivations behind the aggression.

However, there are areas where the summary could be enhanced. For example, while the response mentions the incident involving the agressors and the victim, it lacks details about the severity of the physical attack and how the agressors used intimidation tactics. It also doesn't fully capture the emotional impact on the victim, as it only briefly touches upon the victim's consideration of her gender as a factor contributing to the aggression.

On the other hand, the response does a commendable job of presenting the broader context of the situation, including the political landscape and the communal opposition to the proposed project. It appropriately introduces the concept of the anulación of the PXOM of Vigo and its implications on the legalization of the macrocentro.

Despite these areas for improvement, the response remains largely relevant and accurate in its portrayal of the incident. Therefore, the summary adheres to the majority of the score rubric criteria, as it is mostly relevant and avoids unnecessary details. It successfully distills the essential content of the incident while remaining faithful to the original text.

salamandra-tldr,"The response succinctly summarizes Ana Peleteiro's accomplishment at the 2020 Olympic Games, highlighting her achievement of a bronze medal in the triple jump. It correctly includes important details such as her personal record and her being the first Galician athlete to win an Olympic medal. Furthermore, it provides the exact source for the information, which adds credibility to the summary. However, the response lacks some important elements present in the reference answer, such as mentioning the specific people who superceded Peleteiro in the competition and the fact that she bated her personal record twice consecutively. These missing details reduce the comprehensiveness of the summary. Despite these omissions, the response remains largely focused on the most significant aspects of Peleteiro's performance. So, the response maintains relevancy but could have benefited from additional details that were present in the reference answer. Therefore, it adheres to the score rubric with a score of 4 as it contains mostly relevant information.

Furthermore, the response does not introduce extraneous information or subjective opinions, thereby adhering to the score rubric's requirement for relevance and absence of redundancies. Therefore, based on the score rubric's emphasis on the selection of important content and avoidance of redundancies and subjective elements, the response merits a score of 5.

gpt5-base,"The summary covers the main points from the given text but lacks some details, making it less comprehensive. For instance, it does not mention the attempt by the Spanish government to redirect the project's focus towards the Madrid-Lisboa line. Furthermore, the summary fails to mention the preference of the Portuguese government for the Madrid-Lisboa line because it considers flying between the two cities more convenient than taking a train. It also omits the claim made by the Portuguese minister about the unnecessarily high cost of the Lisboa-Madrid project. Despite these omissions, the summary correctly identifies the main actors involved in the dispute over the ferry connection between Portugal and Spain and their respective stances. It also correctly highlights the importance of the connection for the two countries and the significance of the tramo between Braga and Valença. Therefore, the summary contains mostly relevant information. However, it could have included more detail about the parties' motivations and the specifics of the proposed projects to make it more informative. In terms of the relevance of the information, the summary is effective, yet it could be improved by incorporating additional details to provide a more complete picture of the situation.

It correctly highlights the need for clarity on the nature of the crime (LGBTfóbico) and the urgency for information. However, the response omits details about the incident's time frame and the victim's occupation, which are important to fully comprehend the severity of the crime. Furthermore, while the response correctly lists cities where concentrations were scheduled, it lacks specificity regarding the time and location of these events, a detail that could contribute to a more comprehensive summary.

gpt5-base,"The response provided is indeed a summary of the text about the US presidential election, which does cover the main points of the original document. However, there is a significant amount of extraneous information included in the response. For instance, the reference to the future actions of the candidates is not directly relevant to the summary and could be seen as an unnecessary commentary. Moreover, the inclusion of phrases like 'Biden passes to have the most options' and 'Trump started legal battles' might be seen as redundant in this context. These phrases do not add new information to the summary and could have been used to elaborate on the current situation. The response does meet the criterion of containing most of the relevant information, but it is heavily impacted by the presence of subjective statements and unnecessary commentary. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response would receive a score of 3 because it contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, with the irrelevant information slightly outweighing the relevant information.

gpt5-base,"The summary contains most of the important information from the source document, such as the goal of the Capital Network, the types of proxectos presented, and the investment requirements. However, the summary could be more precise in describing the services or products offered by each proxecto, which could enhance the relevance of the information.

Although the summary captures the spirit of the event, it lacks the level of detail found in the source text. For instance, it does not mention the specific focus areas within the technological and digital sector (TIC) for each proxecto, which is a critical aspect of the text. Furthermore, the summary omits the exact number of presented projects and their selection process.

Overall, while the summary does a good job of summarizing the main points of the original text, it falls slightly short in presenting the details of each proxecto and the event's specificities. Thus, it is not fully aligned with the expectations set by the score rubric.

It also conveys the CIG's stance on these issues and its call for increased efforts and potential mass resignation if the situation does not improve. However, the summary could have provided more detail about the specific changes to the curriculum, which was one of the main points of the original text. Nonetheless, it refrains from introducing subjective opinions or redundant information. Thus, it meets the criteria for a score of 5 according to the score rubric.

gpt5-base,"The response manages to distill the main points from the original text but falls short in some aspects of the task. It does a good job summarizing the event, the reaction of authorities and the community, as well as the proposed actions. However, it lacks the detail and depth present in the original text. For instance, the sentence ""O Concello de Vimianzo, a comunidade escolar e diferentes grupos e partidos políticos condenaram a agresión"" oversimplifies the reactions of different groups and the specific actions of the Concello and the school community. The text does not include the necessary context for understanding the magnitude of the event and the reactions of the community. This omission reduces the overall relevance of the summary, which is crucial for this task. The absence of redundancies and the inclusion of only important information, as indicated in the score rubric, are present in the response but are slightly compromised by the lack of context. While the response is satisfactory in general, it could have been more precise and thorough, adhering more closely to the original text in terms of detail and relevance. So the overall score is 4.

The response avoids redundancies and remains faithful to the original text. However, there is a slight ambiguity regarding the reactions of Ayuso, which could be perceived as a slight misinterpretation of her position on the situation. It is also noticeable that the response could have been slightly more concise, perhaps by eliminating some details that do not add significant value to the summary. Despite these minor issues, the response does a commendable job of highlighting the most important aspects of the text. It maintains relevance throughout and presents a coherent summary without resorting to subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases. Therefore, it aligns well with the rubric's requirements for a high score.

gpt5-base,"The provided response offers a condensed version of the incident involving Irene. It is mostly accurate in summarizing the key points such as the time of the incident, the reason behind it, the physical and verbal aggression, the fact that Irene sought help from the police, and the aftermath involving others who were also subjected to intimidation and hostility.

However, it misses some crucial details, like the explicit mention of the potential impact of the project, the promotion of the project, the context of the ILP and its legal implications, and the broader social and political aspects related to the issue at hand. While these details might seem secondary, they are integral to understanding the gravity and complexity of the situation and its roots in the local community's dynamics.

Furthermore, the response includes subjective statements such as the implications of being a woman and a newcomer, which are not part of the original text and hence, not relevant to the summary. This introduces bias and personal opinion into the summary, which goes against the rubric's requirement of maintaining a neutral and objective tone.

In conclusion, while the response captures the essence of the event and its impact on the victim, it falls short in providing a comprehensive and unbiased summary of the entire scenario. The omission of important information and the inclusion of subjective opinions detract from the quality of the summary, leading to a less complete understanding of the situation.

However, while it briefly mentions the background of Peleteiro, it does not delve into the context of the record being set on the last attempt or the significance of her achievement in terms of the athetes' career. Despite these omissions, the summary is still primarily relevant information. Therefore, according to the score rubric, this response fits in the category of a score 4, as it contains mostly relevant information, although it falls short of a score 5 due to minor contextual details that could have been included.

However, the summary lacks some detail, such as the mention of other services beyond the demand for a center terapéutico and the details of the specific challenges faced in the Costa da Morte area. The missing details reduce the effectiveness of the summary in capturing the full scope of the Asociación's demands and struggles. Nevertheless, the response maintains focus on the key issues and requests made by the Asociación, including the leasing of a local and the request for additional resources for the hospital and the provision of more medical specialties.

gpt5-tldr,"The summary provided captures the main points of the original instruction but omits some details that would enhance the understanding of the context. For instance, it does not mention the exact nature of the request (cesión de local) and the specific problems faced by the association and its members. However, the response still maintains the essence of the original message, summarizing the main issues (demand for a therapeutic center, need for more resources in the hospital, and the issue of accessibility) and the setting (Costa da Morte). The absence of subjective opinions and the use of straightforward language contribute to its clarity and relevance, aligning well with the score rubric's emphasis on summarizing important information without unnecessary details or metalinguistic phrases. Therefore, while there is room for improvement in terms of including more specific details, the summary is generally effective and relevant to the original instruction.

gpt5-tldr,"This response effectively distills the essential details of the investigation into the asassinato of Francisco Javier Romero Taboada, also known as Jimmy. It succinctly captures the core points of the case, including the nature of the crime, the identities and backgrounds of the detained suspects, and the broader political and societal implications. However, while the response does a good job at summarizing the main events, it doesn't fully explore the depth of the story or the nuanced details that would provide a more comprehensive understanding. For instance, the response could have further delved into the allegations of a pact between the ultras and the Deportivo, as well as the criticisms faced by the Deportivo and the government. Furthermore, the response misses the opportunity to discuss the reactions of the public and other parties involved, such as the organised crime units and the forensic analyses of the scene. Although the response is concise, the omission of these aspects makes the summary less thorough than it could be. Therefore, despite being largely accurate and relevant, the response falls short of being as detailed as it could be. It also doesn't fully adhere to the instructions given, which suggests the need for a deeper and more detailed analysis. Hence, considering the rubric's criteria for relevance and completeness, the response is satisfactory but could benefit from a more nuanced approach to the summary. So the overall score is 3.

It adheres to the principles of relevance by focusing solely on the critical aspects of the event. The inclusion of the major themes of the festival, such as ""programación arriscada"" and the emphasis on interdisciplinary art, aligns well with the important elements mentioned in the source. Additionally, the mention of key figures like Yann González, Caroline Poggi, and Jonathan Vinel, as well as the different categories of films and the venues of the festival, contributes to a comprehensive summary. There are no subjective opinions or irrelevant details present in the summary. The response is well-organized, adheres to the structure of the task, and eliminates any redundancy, making it an exemplary summary.

It efficiently summarizes the announcement of the new web portal, highlighting its features, content availability, and the institution's aims. This summary aligns closely with the task of providing a concise yet complete overview of the portal's functionalities and benefits. The absence of redundancies and the relevance of all the information presented make it a high-quality response according to the score rubric. The lack of extraneous details, such as information about the launch event, adheres to the rubric's emphasis on relevancy and conciseness. This suggests that the summary is crafted with a careful selection of essential content, and as such, it maintains the integrity of the source material without any superfluous information.

It encapsulates the key factors that contribute to the reduced digital divide, such as differences in urban-rural areas, age groups, and access to broadband. However, it does not provide as much detail as the reference response. For instance, it does not mention the specific percentage of internet usage by age groups or the impact of digital commerce growth in Galicia compared to the rest of the state. Despite these omissions, the response maintains a good balance of essential information without including unnecessary or redundant details. Therefore, the summary in the response captures the most critical aspects of the source material and remains concise and relevant. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response captures the main points of the initial document but includes extraneous details, such as the status of Galicia Baleira's presidency, which does not directly address the main concerns of the platform. This adds unnecessary length to the summary and diverges from the core focus of the document, which is the platform's proposals to tackle rural issues. Furthermore, the response somewhat fails in presenting a compact version of the original text by omitting some of the most critical details like the emphasis on political action and the different areas where changes are required. These details are essential to fully understand the platform's initiatives and objectives. While the response does address the importance of integrating all sectors of the rural economy, it falls short in adequately summarizing the strategic actions proposed by the platform. Therefore, the response contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, resulting in a lower score based on the rubric's criteria for relevance.

gpt5-tldr,"The summary in the response includes the key points that highlight the main conflict between the Spanish and Portuguese governments over the railway project. It mentions the resistance of the Spanish government to the proposed project, and the stance of the Portuguese government favoring the development of the northern railway line. This response also indicates the financial aspect of the project and the need for cooperation between Spain and Portugal. However, it lacks the detailed information regarding the specific implications for both governments, the nature of the pressure exerted, and the final decision of the Eurocidade Cerveira-Tomiño conference, which is essential to fully understand the complexity of the situation. Additionally, it fails to mention the importance of Madrid as a center and the comparative advantage of using aircraft instead of a high-speed train for Madrid-Lisboa routes. Therefore, the response could be more comprehensive by providing more context and analysis of the political dynamics at play. Nevertheless, the essential points are included, and the summary remains focused on the critical aspects of the dispute. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response provided is generally on point with the main topic of Samuel Luiz's murder and the LGTBI+ movement's response. It correctly identifies Samuel Luiz's nationality, age, place of residence, the cause of his death, and the convocation for a gathering on the day of the murder. However, it omits some critical details such as the exact date and time of the incident, the location where Samuel Luiz died, and the police's current status on the investigation. Furthermore, the response does not mention the exact nature of the incident, which was crucial in understanding the crime's context. It also lacks specific details about the concentration points across different cities in Galicia. Despite these omissions, the response does maintain relevance to the core subject matter, albeit in a somewhat limited scope compared to the full details presented in the original text. So, according to the score rubric, the response contains mostly relevant information, with some missing details.

gpt5-tldr,"The summary captures the essence of the Cluster TIC Capital Network's meeting and the projects selected for funding. It outlines the event's purpose, the participating companies, and the total investment needed. However, the summary lacks detailed descriptions of the selected projects, which could have been included without exceeding the expected word count. This omission results in the summary being less informative compared to the reference response. Furthermore, while the summary does mention the open investment process throughout the year, it does not emphasize the continuous engagement with potential investors as effectively as the reference response. These elements contribute to a score of 4, as the summary includes mostly relevant information but misses some key details. 
[RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The response captures the main points of the issue at hand. It includes the essential details such as the alleged reductions in units and personnel in the education system by the Consellaría de Cultura, Educación e Universidade. However, it fails to delve into the nuances of the complaint raised by the CIG, such as the accusation of ""xogar"" figures, the demand for increased dialogue, and the call for direct action like a mass resignation. While the response touches on the opposition's argument for increased units, it does not clearly articulate the full scope of the CIG's position, particularly the view that the education system should be viewed as an investment rather than a cost. In this light, the response provides a partial picture of the controversy, which results in it containing a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. Hence, it falls short of achieving the highest score, which requires that all information in the summary be relevant.

It succinctly outlines the events in question, mentioning the interception of two different envelopes addressed to prominent figures in Spain. The inclusion of relevant details about the envelopes' contents, the involvement of the police force, and the response of the recipients demonstrates a careful selection of important information from the source text. Furthermore, the response maintains a neutral tone, avoiding any subjective opinions or unnecessary embellishments. This adherence to the requirements of the score rubric results in a summary that accurately reflects the source material, making it relevant and informative. So the overall score is 5.

gpt5-tldr,"The summary provided covers most of the important points from the given instruction. However, it falls short in conveying the full extent of the situation and the impact of the Porto Cabral campaign on the community. For instance, the summary does not mention the role of Intu Eurofunds or the significance of the PXOM of Vigo, which are crucial elements in understanding the context of the conflict. It also fails to highlight the gender-related bias the agressors displayed, which is central to the narrative. The summary correctly identifies the key elements of the story but does so in a way that does not fully capture the gravity of the events described. Despite this, the response largely adheres to the requirement of including only important information without redundancies or subjective opinions. Thus, the overall relevance of the information presented aligns with the score rubric's criteria for a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
gpt5-tldr,"The summary provided effectively condenses the pertinent details of Ana Peleteiro's performance in the Olympic Games of Toquio. It accurately mentions the medalla de bronce won by Peleteiro in the triplo salto feminino, the achievement as the first Olympic medal for a Galician athlete, and her consecutive improvement in her personal record, culminating in the winning jump. The mention of Yulimar Rojas and Patricia Mamona also shows the context of her performance.

However, the summary could be improved by including additional key points such as the fact that Peleteiro achieved this feat on her first attempt and by outlining the historical context of her achievement, which is missing from the original text. These omissions result in a less comprehensive summary than could be provided.

Therefore, while the summary is primarily relevant and aligns closely with the core aspects of the original text, the absence of some important information, such as Peleteiro's achievement on her first attempt and the broader context of her performance, slightly detracts from its completeness.

Thus, the summary fulfills most of the criteria laid out in the score rubric, but there is room for more detail to achieve a higher score. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-base,"The response effectively condenses the original text into a summary. It touches upon the key issues raised by the Asociación de Pacientes Finisterrae, namely the demand for a local to establish a therapy center in Carnota, the request for better healthcare services, and the difficulties faced by the people living in the area due to lack of services. However, it omits certain details, such as the exact number of concellos in the Costa da Morte and the specific mention of the Complexo Hospitalario Universitario de Santiago de Compostela (CHUS) as the only referenced hospital. These omissions slightly reduce the relevance of the summary to the original text, as some specifics that were part of the original text are missing. Yet, it still manages to convey the main points, showing an understanding of the core message without delving into excessive detail. Therefore, the response contains mostly relevant information, justifying a score of 4.

llama3-base,"The provided response contains a specific detail from the original text, which is that the 36 detained were all members of the Frente Atlético. However, it falls short of providing a comprehensive summary of the events and implications mentioned in the text. Important aspects such as the involvement of ex military members, the context of the liorta, the arrest of catro additional individuals in Xixón, and the differing viewpoints and subsequent polémicas are missing. Additionally, the summarization does not capture the range of serious offenses the detained individuals are facing. The response also fails to address the wider societal impacts of the events, such as the pressure applied on the Deportivo club and the consequential strains within the community of the affected football club. Hence, while the response is not devoid of content related to the original text, it is a stark representation of a summary that fails to encapsulate the full scope of the source. This leads to the conclusion that the summary provided in the response is only partially relevant and therefore does not meet the criteria for a higher score as per the score rubric.

The response successfully mentions key elements such as the program's theme, the presentation date, the main actors of the festival, and some of the interdisciplinary projects. However, it omits significant details, such as the festival's aim to expand beyond cinema and the inclusion of various art forms like literature, music, and dance. Moreover, the participation of international figures like the director Pela del Álamo and the artists Sau-Ching Wong and Ak-zi-å are mentioned but not explained in the context of the festival's goal to intertwine different art forms. This lack of specificity and connection of the mentioned details to the festival's overarching objectives results in a summary that is somewhat relevant but not fully encompassing.

It acknowledges the lack of progress in some rural areas and for older demographics. The summary mentions the higher usage of Internet in Galicia, particularly among younger individuals, compared to the national average. However, the response could be improved by providing more specific data points, such as percentages of access and usage, and detailing the impact of these figures on Galicia's digital divide. Additionally, it doesn't mention how Galicia's digital growth rate compares to Spain's, which is a significant point made in the original text. So while it contains mostly relevant information, it lacks depth and specificity. Thus, it aligns better with the score of 4 in the rubric, rather than a score of 5.

llama3-base,"The response provided is a direct copy of the source text without adding or summarizing any information. It fails to meet the requirement for relevance as outlined in the score rubric. The response simply echoes the original text, including all the unnecessary details, which does not demonstrate the ability to select important content or to add new information. It does not show any attempt at summarization or adaptation of the text to a more concise or coherent format. Furthermore, it does not provide any additional context or interpretation of the text. This approach does not contribute to the understanding of the original text or provide insight into its key points.

While it does address the main points of opposition to the conexión between Lisboa and Vigo by the Spanish government, it does not fully capture the depth of the conversation. It mentions the secretario de Estado de Infraestruturas, Sergio Vázquez Torrón, and the negative stance of the Spanish executive towards the study for the conexion. However, it fails to include the important aspect of the pressures exerted by the Spanish government on the Portuguese government to cease the project and instead focus on the Lisboa-Madrid connection. Additionally, the summary does not mention the issues related to the finalization of the study or the significance of the Eurocidade Cerveira-Tomiño meetings. 

The information included is pertinent but it does not cover all key elements from the original text, resulting in a less comprehensive summary. It does not delve into the discussions on the potential costs and funding options, nor does it address the positions of the ministers and the decisions made in the Cumio Hispano-Portugués. Furthermore, it misses the points regarding the outlook on the conexion between Braga and Valença, as well as the inter-regional dynamics that influence the decision-making process. 

Based on the evaluation criteria, the response falls short of capturing all the important information from the source document, which is essential for a complete and accurate summary.

llama3-base,"The response provided lacks the necessary detail and comprehensiveness to adequately summarize the given text. It simply states ""A denúncia do asasinato de Samuel Luiz"" without delving into the specifics of the incident or the context surrounding it. This approach fails to address key points such as the age and profession of Samuel Luiz, the number of concentrations organized, or the locations where these events took place. Additionally, the response lacks any mention of the ongoing investigation or the stance taken by Avante LGTBI+. The brevity of the summary and its failure to include relevant details from the original text result in a summary that does not meet the requirements of the rubric.

llama3-base,"The response provided is a summary of the text, which fulfills the task's requirement to an extent. However, it is noteworthy that the summary contains a large amount of repetitive information and fails to emphasize the key points that are most critical in understanding the event described. For instance, the response repeatedly mentions the Cluster TIC Capital Network and its purpose but does not provide substantial information about the nine projects selected or the objective of the forum. It also presents some facts in a way that may not be as informative as desired, such as stating that the projects selected need an investment of catro millóns of euros without specifying what the investment would be used for. Additionally, the summary contains several sentences that are essentially the same, which does not add value to the summary and contributes to the overall lack of depth in understanding the event. These issues lead to a summary that does not fully convey the essence and importance of the Cluster TIC Capital Network. Therefore, the response is deemed to be a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, according to the score rubric.

While it accurately reflects the main issues – the critique from the CIG regarding the reduction in units and staff, the idea that the Consellaría may be trying to mislead the public with misrepresented figures, and the call for collective action – it lacks the specificity of the accusation being made. The details about the reduction of 127 units and the creation of 19 new units is absent, which is a critical piece of information that could significantly impact the community's understanding of the situation. Additionally, it omits the direct quotes used to highlight the seriousness of the situation, such as ""a elevar ao máximo o fechamento de unidades e a redução de docentes no ensino primario"" and ""en plena pandemia e con todas as incertezas."" These omissions result in a summary that, while generally accurate, doesn't capture the full complexity and urgency conveyed in the original text.

Additionally, the phrase ""Irene está a estudar possíveis ações legais"" seems more like a statement of fact rather than a key element of the summary that should provide insight into the aftermath of the incident. These elements do not entirely align with the expectations set by the score rubric, which prefers summaries to be free from unnecessary details and subjective opinions.

While it includes all the elements of the 5W1H method, it is rather brief and does not delve into specifics, such as the nature of the problems faced, the kind of industries being targeted, or the measures suggested for improvement. The response could have been more informative by expanding on these points. Nevertheless, it does a satisfactory job in summarizing the main points of the original text, avoiding excessive information or subjective opinions. Thus, it meets the criteria outlined in the score rubric, ensuring all the information included is relevant to the task. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The provided response does well in summarizing the key points of the original text, effectively applying the 5W1H method. It succinctly covers the what (the conexión), the who (the parties involved), the when (the timeframe discussed), and the where (the locations mentioned). The response also briefly addresses the why (the reasons behind the positions of the respective governments) and the how (the actions taken or proposed).

However, the response falls short of providing a comprehensive overview of the complexities and nuances involved in the conexão ferroviaria atlántica between Lisboa e Vigo. It lacks detail on the contentious nature of the project, the financial aspects and the plans for the future, which were presented in the original text. For instance, the importance of the strategic decision to prioritize the eixo atlántico, and the potential cost savings, were not fully explained in the summary.

Additionally, there is a minor deviation from the task at hand. The summary, while relevant to the source text, does not convey the full scope of the intergovernmental negotiations and discussions that took place during the cumio, including the pressures exerted by both governments.

In conclusion, the summary contains mostly relevant information, but it misses some important details from the original text. Therefore, based on the rubric which emphasizes the inclusion of all relevant information and a clear focus on the task, the score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The provided response effectively utilizes the 5W1H method to summarize the complex situation surrounding the death of Samuel Luiz. It presents the essential details: who Samuel Luiz is, what happened, when the incident occurred, where the asasinato took place, why it occurred, and how it was carried out. However, while it captures the main points, the response does not include some key details like the fact that the investigation is being carried out by the Policía Nacional, the details of the victim's life, and the number of cities and towns where concentrations have been planned. It also does not mention the expected increase in the number of concentrations planned for the 5th of May. The inclusion of these elements could have provided a more comprehensive summary, adhering more closely to the original text. Despite this, the response does not contain any irrelevant information and refrains from including any metalinguistic phrases. Therefore, based on the provided rubric, the response is well-constructed and contains mostly relevant information, despite missing out on some details that were present in the original text. So the overall score is 4.  [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response provided is the exact opposite of what was expected. It fails to address any aspect of the 5W1H method, instead offering a condensed version of the original text. It does not provide a summary based on the 5W1H method and thus does not meet the requirements of the instruction.

The given instruction asks for a summary using the 5W1H method (what, who, when, where, why and how) of the provided text. The provided response, however, merely reiterates some elements from the original text without rephrasing them in a summarized form or addressing the 5W1H method specifically. This results in a summary that is vague, lacks essential details, and doesn't provide any clarity or insight into the content of the original text.

The summary does not include any of the necessary components such as what the situation is, who is involved, when the events took place, where the events occurred, why they are significant, or how the situation has evolved. Instead, it provides a repetition of certain points without any contextualization or elaboration.

Therefore, according to the score rubric, which prioritizes relevance and inclusion of the essential components of the 5W1H method, the response is clearly inadequate. It does not fulfill the requirements of the instruction, and the summary is neither relevant nor insightful. Thus, based on the evaluation criteria, the response receives a score of 1. 
[RESULT] 1",1
llama3-5w1h,"The response summarizes the text effectively, adhering to the 5W1H method, and addressing all the main aspects of the event: the what, who, when, where, why, and how of the Capital Network. However, the response could have been more comprehensive by including more details about the nine projects, such as their areas of focus, which were mentioned in the original text but not included in the summary. The inclusion of these details would have made the summary more complete and informative. This omission means that some key information was lost in the process of summarization. While the response did manage to capture the essence of the event, the additional details would have strengthened the summary. Therefore, in terms of relevance and the inclusion of important information from the source, the response did well, but there's room for improvement in covering all the essential elements of the text. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"This summary is relevant to the task, incorporating all key points from the text, such as the identity of the accused party (A Consellaría de Cultura, Educación e Universidade), the issue being criticized (the reduction of unities and personnel in the education system), and the calling for further action (from the central sindical nationalista CIG). However, it does not mention the date of the denunciation (9 de agosto), the specific figures of the reduction (109 unidades and 150 mestras e mestres), and the overall stance of the Consellería regarding the education needs during the pandemic. Although these omissions make the summary less detailed than the reference response, it still captures the essence of the text in a concise manner. The inclusion of these specific details would have increased the score. 

Moreover, the summary could be improved by incorporating the argument presented by the CIG against the changes made by the Consellería. The importance of the education system's need for resources during such a challenging time was acknowledged by the CIG but this point was not explicitly mentioned in the summary. It is essential to capture these nuanced arguments when summarizing a complex issue. 

In terms of the rubric, this summary is certainly rich in relevant content. It efficiently encapsulates the main elements from the original text, making it a well-rounded summary. However, it falls short in capturing some of the finer points, which would have given the summary more depth and clarity. Therefore, the summary receives a score of 4, as it mostly includes relevant information, with room for improvement in the areas of detail and comprehensiveness. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response provides an adequate summary using the 5W1H method. It includes the necessary elements of what happened, who was involved, where the event took place, and why the event occurred. However, it lacks some specific details such as the Garda Civil's actions, the involvement of the local council and the community's reactions, and the political responses to the event. It also does not provide any information on how the incident is being addressed or the next steps to be taken. In light of the scoring rubric which emphasizes the inclusion of all relevant information, this response only partially fulfills the requirements. While it does contain mostly relevant information, there are noticeable gaps that prevent it from achieving a full score. Therefore, considering the elements of relevance and completeness, the response earns a score of 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"The response aligns with the provided instruction to summarize the text using the 5W1H method. It successfully distills the important details from the text into a compact and coherent summary. Each part of the summary corresponds to one of the 5W1H categories, effectively addressing what, who, when, where, why, and how. The information provided is all relevant, without the inclusion of irrelevant or redundant details, which aligns with the scoring rubric. Furthermore, the response avoids any subjective opinions, adhering to the directive provided in the instruction. Based on these observations, it is clear that the summary is well-crafted, focusing on the critical aspects of the original text. Consequently, the response meets all the criteria outlined in the score rubric and thus would receive a score of 5. 
[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-5w1h,"The response is relevant as it condenses the information from the source text, focusing on key details such as the protagonist's name, the date of the incident, the location, and the reason behind the aggression. It captures the essence of the original text by succinctly detailing the events of that day and the subsequent investigation. However, it falls short in mentioning the broader context of the incident, which includes the political climate, the community's stance on the project, and the aggressive tactics used by those supporting the project. This lack of contextual information reduces the comprehensiveness of the summary. So the overall score is 4, because while the summary is mostly relevant, it misses out on a few crucial aspects that were covered in the original text. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-5w1h,"While the summary does adhere to the 5W1H method, it falls short in capturing the full essence of Ana Peleteiro's achievement. It omits key details such as the exact height of Peleteiro's final jump, her competition with the world champion Yulimar Rojas, and the exact timeframe during which she reached her personal best. This leaves a significant gap in the summary, failing to fully convey the context and gravity of Peleteiro's success. In contrast, the reference answer provides a comprehensive picture of Peleteiro's triumph, aligning more closely with the rubric's criteria for relevance and detail. Although it's a brief summary, it succeeds in including all the crucial elements that make up the original text. Therefore, it could be argued that the score rubric requires a more complete retelling of the source text, akin to the reference response provided. So the overall score is 4. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided is quite brief and captures the essence of the Asociación's demands, but lacks some crucial details that contribute to the full understanding of the issue. While it does mention the association's request for a local to open a therapy center and improvements in the hospital, it does not explicitly address the dire need for such services due to the high population density in the Costa da Morte area and the remoteness from adequate healthcare facilities. The omission of these aspects makes the summary less informative compared to the source text. Despite this, the summary does not contain irrelevant or excess information, which aligns with the requirement for relevance in the score rubric. It also avoids subjective opinions that were not part of the original text, which is another criterion from the score rubric. Thus, although the summary is somewhat lacking in detail, it remains largely relevant to the original text, without any subjective opinions. So the overall score is 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided does capture some key elements of the original text, such as the arrest of 36 people, the implication of members of the Frente Atlético, and the accusation of two individuals who are described as a military person and a Garda civil officer. However, it lacks depth and does not include crucial details like the date of the asassination, the involvement of other groups like the Ultra Boys, or the controversy over the actions of the police and the club. The response fails to mention the events that transpired before and after the incident, the reactions from different parties, and the role of the army and police in the events. It also misses the details about the specifics of the case, which are necessary for a complete understanding of the situation. Therefore, while the response does cover some important aspects, it also contains significant omissions that make the summary incomplete. As per the score rubric, this indicates that the summary contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information, aligning it more closely to a score of 3 rather than 5. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided captures the essence of the event, focusing on the interdisciplinary nature and the risk-taking approach of the ""Curtocircuíto 2021"" festival. It successfully mentions key aspects such as the objective to expand beyond the audiovisual sector and the introduction of several new disciplines like photography, dance, and visual arts. However, while the summary covers many relevant details, it lacks specificity regarding the event's duration, the location of the activities, and the composition of the jury. These omissions slightly reduce the richness of the summary. Despite these, the summary remains largely informative and adheres closely to the instruction, addressing the major points about the festival's focus on cultural diversity and cross-disciplinary integration. Therefore, based on the scoring rubric, this response is more relevant and comprehensive than one that contains predominantly irrelevant information, justifying a higher score. 
[RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"The response provided is very brief and lacks the detailed context of the original document. It fails to capture the essence of the new portal presented by the Real Academia Galega (RAG), which includes the variety of content available, the significance of the event for promoting public knowledge, and the future plans of the RAG to enhance its collection. There's no mention of the figures who were present during the presentation of the new web, nor the availability of different types of documents like discursos of ingress or volumes on toponimia. This omission reduces the relevance and richness of the information being conveyed. Hence, according to the score rubric, which prioritizes the selection of important content from the source document, the summary provided does not meet these criteria adequately. Therefore, it receives a lower score for lacking relevant details from the source text. 
[RESULT] 2",2
llama3-tldr,"This response effectively distills the original text into a brief, yet comprehensive summary of the data regarding Galicia's digital divide and its standing relative to Spain. It encapsulates the key points about the differences in Internet usage and availability between Galicia and the rest of Spain, highlighting specific trends, such as the pronounced difference in usage among different age groups, and the regional disparities between urban and rural areas. By omitting any extraneous or subjective comments, the summary remains entirely focused on the key aspects of the original text. Therefore, it aligns perfectly with the scoring rubric's requirement for relevance and avoidance of redundancy, excess information, and subjective opinions. The fact that the summary is accurate and complete, capturing all essential points, demonstrates a high level of comprehension and summarization skills. 
[RESULT] 5",5
llama3-tldr,"The given response captures the essence of the plataforma Galicia Baleira and its mission to counteract the urbanization process in rural areas. It succinctly presents the initiative and its implications for the rural population. However, it lacks detail regarding the proposed actions and does not elaborate on the importance of these measures. For instance, it does not specify how the platform intends to promote economic development or how it plans to improve public services in rural areas. It also fails to address the challenges associated with the integration of rural areas into the digital economy and the transportation network. Additionally, it omits any mention of the platform's approach to political advocacy and its interaction with different political groups. These omissions result in a summary that, while generally relevant, could be enriched with more precise and actionable information from the source document. This is why the summary only partially fulfills the requirements of the score rubric. Thus, the response falls short in providing a comprehensive and informative summary of the original text. It also includes some redundancies and lacks the in-depth analysis present in the original text. These shortcomings reduce the overall quality of the summary. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided is largely aligned with the key points raised in the original text, capturing the core content regarding the Spanish government's position on the conexión ferroviaria between Lisboa and Vigo. It successfully encapsulates the opposition of the Spanish government and its senior officials towards the study and execution of the proposed project, as well as the apparent disagreement on the prioritization of the North-South connection within Spain. 

However, while the summary does touch upon the various viewpoints and positions, it misses out on certain details that were present in the original text. For instance, it does not mention the role of the prime minister of Spain in the situation nor does it explicitly mention the inclusion of the proposed project in the Portuguese government's plan for the recovery phase. The lack of these details in the summary could potentially impact the comprehensiveness and relevance of the summary as a whole.

Furthermore, the response provides only a cursory overview of the conflicting priorities and does not delve into the nuances that exist between the two countries. This could result in a less robust understanding of the issue at hand.

In light of the above considerations, the summary, while generally accurate and relevant, could benefit from incorporating more details and offering a deeper exploration of the complexities involved. This would allow for a more complete and informative summary. 

Therefore, while the summary is mostly relevant and correctly identifies the main issues, it lacks the depth and specificity that would make it a truly comprehensive summary.

llama3-tldr,"The provided response effectively distills the key elements from the extensive text of the original instruction. It captures the essence of the mobilization calls for Samuel Luiz's asasinato and the push for LGBTfobic crime to be acknowledged. This condensed summary is aligned with the objective of summarizing without loss of vital content. Moreover, it does not include redundancies, metalinguistic phrases, or subjective opinions, which aligns with the score rubric's requirements for a high score.

On the other hand, a lower-scoring response would contain more information, some of which may be irrelevant or not directly related to the main points of the instruction. While this information might provide additional context or details, it does not meet the criteria for a relevant summary as per the score rubric.

The response's concise delivery of crucial details related to the mobilization and the tragic event of Samuel Luiz's asasinato makes it superior to a summary with more extraneous information. Therefore, considering the balance between completeness and brevity, the response meets the criteria for a high score, as it includes only relevant information without redundancy or excess detail.

llama3-tldr,"This response successfully captures the key points of the given instruction, specifically focusing on the current standings in the presidential elections. It highlights the crucial 26 electoral votes that have pushed Biden towards becoming the next president, and also touches upon the legal battle initiated by Trump, which indicates a focus on relevant and significant details from the source. There is an absence of unnecessary details, metalinguistic phrases, or subjective opinions that deviate from the core information provided in the original text. Thus, it adheres closely to the criteria of relevance and conciseness as laid out in the score rubric. Therefore, based on these considerations, this response aligns well with the score of 5.

llama3-tldr,"The response provided a very brief summary of the event. It only included the basic details about the Clúster TIC Capital Network and the presentation of nine proxectos. The information was mainly accurate and relevant, but it lacked the depth and detail of the original text. For instance, the specific names of the projects were mentioned but not elaborated upon, and there was no mention of the goals of the event, such as promoting the creation of EBT, or of the financing mechanisms and the significance of attracting private investors. Furthermore, the response did not address the ongoing process of investment, which was a key point in the original text. In essence, while the response did cover some of the relevant information, it failed to convey the full scope of the event. The lack of detail and context indicates a lower relevance and thus would not meet the high standards set for a score of 5. Therefore, according to the rubric, this response does not fully satisfy the criteria for relevance and detail, which would result in a lower score. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"The summary provided captures the core of the controversy at hand but lacks the detailed context and nuances that would give it a fuller understanding. While the summary correctly identifies the reduction of units and teachers as well as the difference between the two, it fails to elaborate on the timing of these developments or the specifics of the proposed cuts. It also overlooks the broader implications and reactions from various stakeholders. Furthermore, it doesn't mention the call for collective action or the next steps in this evolving situation. These omissions result in a summary that, while not entirely off the mark, does not fully convey the complexity and urgency of the issue. 

By contrast, the reference summary includes all these elements, providing a more comprehensive picture of the situation. The inclusion of details such as the date of the CIG's denunciation, the impact on the teaching staff, the implications for the education system, and the broader societal reaction all contribute to a more nuanced understanding of the situation. Additionally, the call for collective action and the next steps in this situation, which were absent in the provided summary, are clearly outlined in the reference. 

In conclusion, while the summary does cover some key points, it fails to provide a complete and nuanced understanding of the situation, which is crucial given the complexity of the issue. This is why the provided summary falls short of achieving a score of 5 on the rubric. It does, however, include relevant information and, as a result, doesn't completely disregard the original text.

llama3-tldr,"The response provides a concise summary of the incident, capturing key details such as the identity of the home involved, the severity of the attack, and the subsequent actions by the Garda Civil and the local council. It correctly focuses on the main points, reflecting the rubric's requirement for relevancy. However, the response misses some details that are significant in the context of the incident, such as the candidacy of Javier M. for the alcaldía and the involvement of political parties and community organizations. Additionally, it does not mention the call for solidarity that was part of the original text. These omissions cause the response to lose some of its relevance, particularly in regards to the social and political context of the incident. The response could be improved by incorporating these elements to provide a more complete summary. Despite these shortcomings, the response does not contain redundancies or excess information and avoids any metalinguistic phrases. Therefore, considering the rubric's emphasis on relevance and its absence of irrelevant or superfluous information, the response earns a score of 4. [RESULT] 4",4
llama3-tldr,"This summary captures the essence of the original text, focusing on the critical details involving the investigation of the attempted delivery of a letter containing bullets to the President of the Community of Madrid, and the discovery of a second package addressed to the Director of the Guardia Civil. It does so without including extraneous or irrelevant details, thus aligning closely with the score rubric's requirement for relevance. Additionally, the summary does not introduce subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases, further ensuring its alignment with the score rubric's criteria. The inclusion of relevant information without redundancy or excess details results in a high-quality summary. So the overall score is 5. [RESULT] 5",5
llama3-tldr,"This response does a satisfactory job in summarizing the crucial aspects of the given scenario. It captures the fundamental elements: the identification of the agressor, the age and gender of the victim, and the reason for the confrontation, which is related to a controversial urban development project. However, it omits the detailed context and events that occurred prior to and during the incident, such as the initial warning to the property owner, the subsequent intimidation and forced entry, and the supporting messages and testimonies from other individuals who were also targeted. This lack of depth in the summary limits its relevance and effectiveness in conveying the full scope of the incident. As a result, while the response covers some key points, it falls short in terms of providing a comprehensive understanding of the situation. Therefore, based on the rubric, it aligns more with the description for a score of 3, as it contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information. 
[RESULT] 3",3
llama3-tldr,"While the given response correctly states the achievement of Ana Peleteiro at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics, it lacks depth in its summary.

Furthermore, it fails to mention the medals won by the other participants and how Peleteiro's performance compares to them. The absence of these details makes the response less informative than it could be. 

However, it is important to note that the response adheres to the rubric's requirement for relevance, as it includes key aspects of Peleteiro's achievement. It successfully conveys the core information without veering into irrelevant or excess details, thereby avoiding redundancies or subjective opinions.
