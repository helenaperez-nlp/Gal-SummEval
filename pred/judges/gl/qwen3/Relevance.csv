salamandra-base," [INST]Okay, let me start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on relevance—ensuring the summary includes only important information without redundancies or subjective opinions. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer is a 5, so it's the ideal summary. The response to evaluate mentions ""Dous meses despois"" but the original text says ""Dúas semanas despois,"" so there's a time discrepancy. That's a mistake. Also, it refers to ""preto de corenta persoas"" which might be a typo for ""cercano a ciento"" (near 100), but the original says ""máis de trinta"" (over thirty). The response adds ""membros doutras organizacións ultras"" which isn't explicitly stated in the original. It also includes ""algúns destes individuos teñen antecedentes militares ou policiais"" which is a paraphrase, but the original mentions some details about military and police backgrounds. However, the response doesn't mention the key points like the operation name, the specific groups involved (Frente Atlético, Ultra Boys), the location (Madrid, Xixón), the charges, and the political fallout. It also omits important details like the victim's name and the specific incident (malleira, río Manzanares). There's also a mention of ""servizos de intelixencia"" which isn't in the original text. The summary has some inaccuracies and misses crucial elements from the reference answer. So, based on the rubric, this response includes some relevant info but also introduces errors and omits key points. It doesn't fully meet the criteria for a score of 5, but it's not entirely irrelevant either. Considering the rubric, it might fall into a lower score, maybe 3 or 4, but the inaccuracies and omissions might push it to 3.
[/INST]

The response includes some relevant information about the number of detainees and their affiliation with groups like the Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys, but it introduces inaccuracies such as the incorrect time frame (""dous meses"" instead of ""dúas semanas"") and a typo (""corenta"" instead of ""ciento""). It also omits critical details like the operation name (""Neptuno""), the specific victim's name (Francisco Javier Romero Taboada), and the nature of the attack (malleira, río Manzanares). Additionally, it adds phrases like ""servizos de intelixencia"" not present in the original text. These errors and omissions reduce its relevance. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let me start by understanding what's required here. The task is to evaluate a response based on a given rubric and provide feedback along with a score. The instruction was to summarize a text about the Clúster TIC Capital Network event in Compostela. The response to evaluate is about the attendees of the event, listing financial institutions and organizations. The reference answer, which scores a 5, summarizes the event's purpose, the number of projects selected, and briefly mentions each project. 

First, I need to check the rubric. The key points are relevance, selecting important content, avoiding redundancies, and not including subjective opinions. The response to evaluate lists various financial institutions and organizations present. However, the original text's main focus was on the event's purpose, the projects selected, and their details. The response provided here doesn't mention the event's goal, the selected projects, or the funding amount. Instead, it focuses on the attendees, which is a detail but not the core information. 

According to the rubric, a score of 5 requires all information to be relevant. Since the response misses the main points about the event's purpose and the selected projects, it's not capturing the essential information. It's more about the participants rather than the event's objectives or outcomes. The reference answer includes the key elements: event name, purpose, number of projects, funding, and brief project descriptions. 

The response to evaluate doesn't mention the event's purpose, the 9 projects, the 4 million euros, or the main activities. Therefore, it's missing crucial details. Even though listing the attendees might be relevant, it's not the primary focus of the original text. The rubric penalizes summaries that don't include important information. Hence, this response is not aligned with the reference answer's structure and content, leading to a lower score. 

Considering the rubric, the summary should include the main points. Since the response only covers a part of the information and misses the core elements, it would likely score lower. The presence of the attendees is a detail but not the main content. So, the score should be 2 because it has a large amount of irrelevant information compared to the main points. However, maybe it's not entirely irrelevant. But since the main points are missing, it's more like a mix. Wait, the rubric says score 3 is a mix. But if the summary is missing the main points, perhaps it's 2. Let me check again. The original text's main points are the event's purpose, the projects, and the funding. The response only talks about attendees. Therefore, the information is not relevant to the main purpose. So, it's more like score 2, which has a large amount of irrelevant information. But maybe even less. Alternatively, it's focusing on a detail but not the main content. So, the score might be 2. But I need to be precise. The rubric for 2 says ""contains a large amount of irrelevant information."" The response here is about attendees, which is a detail but not the main point. The original text's main points are the event's purpose and the projects. The response doesn't mention those, so it's missing key info. Therefore, it's not just irrelevant but missing important content. However, the rubric's 1 is when the summary is the original text or irrelevant. Since the response is not the original text, but it's missing the main points, perhaps it's a 2. Alternatively, maybe 3 because it's a mix. Hmm. The original text mentions the event's purpose, the number of projects, the funding, and the list of projects. The response is about attendees, which is a detail. So, the information is not relevant to the main purpose. Therefore, the summary is missing key info, which would be a 2. But maybe the attendees are relevant? Well, the reference answer didn't mention attendees either. So, the response isn't aligned with the reference answer. But the rubric says that the summary should include important information. Since the response doesn't include the main points, it's not relevant. Hence, score 2.
[/INST]

(Relevance - The response focuses on attendees rather than the event's purpose, selected projects, or funding details, which are critical elements of the source text. It omits key information such as the event's goal, the 9 selected projects, and the 4 million euros investment, making the summary less relevant to the primary content.) [RESULT] 2

Okay, let me start by looking at the response to evaluate. The user wants a summary of the given text about the Galician education ministry's changes and the union's criticism. The reference answer got a score of 5, so I need to compare the evaluated response against that.

First, I'll check the relevance of the evaluated response. The main points from the original text are the CIG union's accusation that the ministry is manipulating numbers, the reduction of 109 units and 150 teachers, their call for action, and the ministry's defense that there will be more units than before the pandemic. 

Looking at the evaluated response, it mentions the union's point about the reduction and the ministry's claim about more units. However, there's some extra information like ""fontes sindicais consultadas por este medio"" and ""Galicia contará cun total de 346 escolas públicas durante o vindeiro ano lectivo (2021-2022)"". Wait, the original text doesn't mention the number of schools, so that's adding irrelevant info. Also, the phrase ""segundo datos oficiais publicados recentemente"" isn't in the original text. That's a problem because the rubric penalizes adding extra information not present. 

Also, the evaluated response includes phrases like ""non hai ningunha unidade máis"" which is a bit subjective and not directly stated in the original text. The original says they are reducing some and creating others but the numbers are lower. The evaluated response might be interpreting that as ""no more units,"" which could be a slight misrepresentation. 

So the summary includes some relevant info but also adds irrelevant details and possibly some subjective interpretations. According to the rubric, that would lead to a score of 2, as it has a large amount of irrelevant information. The reference answer didn't include the school numbers or the ""fontes sindicais"" part, so the evaluated response is penalized for those. Therefore, the score should be 2.
[/INST]

(Relevance - The response includes some relevant information about the CIG union's criticism and the ministry's stance but introduces irrelevant details such as ""Galicia contará cun total de 346 escolas públicas"" and references to ""fontes sindicais consultadas por este medio,"" which are not present in the original text. These additions dilute the focus on the core issue of unit reductions and teacher cuts. Additionally, the phrase ""non hai ningunha unidade máis"" is a subjective interpretation not directly supported by the source.) [RESULT] 2",2.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The main criteria here are relevance and avoiding excess information. The reference answer gets a score of 5 because all the information is relevant.

First, I'll check the response to evaluate. The user's response starts by talking about external companies collecting signatures and offering money, which is mentioned in the original text. But wait, the original text doesn't mention anything about companies offering money. The original text mentions that the campaign is run by the Xunta Reitora and some collectives, but there's no mention of external companies paying for signatures. So that part is adding information not present in the source. That's a problem because it introduces irrelevant info.

Then the response mentions that some people feel they were tricked, which is a subjective opinion. The original text says that people who didn't sign reported being harassed, but the response is adding that they feel tricked, which isn't stated in the source. That's another issue of introducing subjective opinions not in the text.

Next, the response talks about pressure on local businesses, which is also not mentioned in the original text. The original mentions that the campaign is being run by certain groups, but there's no mention of pressure on merchants. So that's another addition.

The response then mentions the debate in Vigo about economic opportunities vs environmental effects. The original text does talk about the debate, but the response adds details about the debate that aren't in the source. For example, the original says the campaign has caused a social debate, but the response adds specifics about sectors viewing it as an opportunity and others warning about negative effects. These specifics aren't in the original text, so that's adding information.

Finally, the response ends with a summary that just states ""Unha muller de Vigo"" which is incomplete and doesn't capture the key points. The reference answer includes all the necessary details about Irene, the incident, the location, the campaign, and the consequences. The evaluated response misses these key points, especially the specific details about the attack and the legal actions.

Putting this together, the response includes irrelevant information (like external companies paying, pressure on businesses), introduces subjective opinions not in the text, and omits key details from the original. According to the rubric, this would be a score of 1 because it's mostly irrelevant or adds unimportant info. However, the response does mention some relevant points like the campaign and the debate, but the majority of the added content is not in the source. Therefore, the score should be 1.
[/INST]
The response includes irrelevant information not present in the source, such as claims about external companies offering money for signatures and pressure on local businesses, which are not mentioned in the original text. It also introduces subjective opinions (e.g., ""foran enganados"") not found in the source. Additionally, it omits critical details about the specific incident involving Irene, the legal campaign, and the broader context of the dispute. [RESULT] 1",1.0
salamandra-base," [INST]Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on relevance—ensuring the summary includes only important information from the source without redundancies, subjective opinions, or metalinguistic phrases. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer is concise and hits all key points: Ana Peleteiro's bronze medal in the triple jump, her personal best of 14.87m, beating Rickets, and being the first Galician athlete to win a medal in Tokyo. It's brief and sticks to the facts.

Looking at the response to evaluate, it starts well by mentioning the bronze medal and the significance for Galicia. However, it adds information about the second-best Spanish record (14.93m) and mentions Ruth Beitia's record. Wait, the original text doesn't mention Ruth Beitia or the Spanish record. That's a problem because it introduces new data not present in the source. Also, the response says ""Galicia achieved its first Olympic medal in history,"" but the original text only mentions that it's the first for a Galician athlete, not necessarily the first for Galicia overall. That's a slight overstatement. 

Additionally, the response has a trailing off at the end: ""Grazas a isto, entrou directamente na historia como a única muller capaz de saltar máis alá dos..."" which seems cut off and might be a metalinguistic phrase or an incomplete thought. The reference answer doesn't have this, so that's a red flag. 

The response also mentions that the bronze is the second-best Spanish record, which isn't in the original text. This is adding irrelevant information. The original text only talks about her personal best and the comparison with Rickets and Yulimar Rojas. The mention of Ruth Beitia's record is an extra detail not present. 

So, the response has some irrelevant information and possibly subjective opinions. According to the rubric, this would lower the score. The reference answer is perfect because it only includes the essential details without any added info. The evaluated response has some inaccuracies and extra info, so it should get a lower score. 

Now, applying the rubric: the response has some relevant info but also includes irrelevant details and possibly incorrect claims. So, it might fall into a score 3, as there's a mix of relevant and irrelevant info. However, the mention of Ruth Beitia and the Spanish record might be more than just a mix. Maybe a score 2? But the user's example might suggest a different approach. Wait, the user's example had a response with similar issues and got a 3. Let me check again. The response mentions the second-best Spanish record and Ruth Beitia, which aren't in the source. That's adding information not present, which is a penalty. Also, the incomplete ending. So, perhaps a score 3 because there's a mix of relevant and irrelevant info. But the user's example might have different penalties. Alternatively, the presence of subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases could lower it further. Since the response doesn't have subjective opinions, maybe it's a 3. The key points are there, but with extra info. So, I'll go with a 3.
[/INST]

The response includes some relevant information, such as Ana Peleteiro's bronze medal, her personal best of 14.87m, and her status as the first Galician athlete to win an Olympic medal in Tokyo. However, it introduces irrelevant details like the claim that this is ""the second-best Spanish record"" (not mentioned in the source) and references Ruth Beitia's record, which are not part of the original text. These additions constitute redundancies and excess information, violating the relevance criterion. Additionally, the response ends abruptly with an incomplete phrase, which may indicate a metalinguistic error. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response using the 5W1H method and a rubric based on relevance. The reference answer got a 5, so I need to compare the evaluated response to that.

First, I'll check the response to evaluate. The user provided a response that starts with a quote about the measure being necessary for safety. Then it lists ""Quen,"" ""Cando,"" etc., which are the 5W1H elements. However, the summary part is quite brief and seems to miss some key details from the original text. For example, the reference answer mentions the operation Neptuno, the number of detentions, the groups involved (Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys), the timeline (two weeks after the murder), the cause (brutal attack leading to death), and the consequences (politics, security issues). 

Looking at the evaluated response, it mentions the 36 detentions, the groups, the two weeks after the murder, and the cause. But it's very brief and lacks depth. Also, the initial part about the measure being necessary isn't part of the original text and seems like a subjective opinion, which might be penalized. Additionally, the response doesn't mention important details like the involvement of military personnel, the specific methods of the attack (like using sticks and metal bars), the police operation details, and the political fallout mentioned in the reference answer. 

The rubric emphasizes relevance and penalizes subjective opinions or irrelevant info. The evaluated response includes some irrelevant parts (like the quote about the measure) and omits key points from the source. So, according to the rubric, this would be a lower score. The reference answer includes all relevant info without extraneous details. Therefore, the evaluated response probably scores around 2 or 3. But since it includes some relevant info but misses much, maybe a 3? Wait, the rubric says Score 3 is a mix of relevant and irrelevant. The evaluated response has both the initial irrelevant quote and some relevant points. So, the score would be 3. But I need to check if there are any other penalties. The response doesn't have metalinguistic phrases like ""Here is the summary,"" so that's okay. However, the initial quote might be considered a subjective opinion. Since the original text doesn't mention that measure, that's an addition. Therefore, the score would be 3 because it's a mix of relevant and irrelevant info, and includes a subjective opinion. But the rubric says score 3 is a mix, so that fits. But the response also has some relevant points. So, the final score is 3.
[/INST]
(Feedback for Relevance) The response includes some relevant information (e.g., number of detentions, groups involved, timeline) but also introduces subjective opinions (e.g., ""another part of the fans sees this measure as necessary"") not present in the original text.

salamandra-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the response based on the given rubric. First, I need to understand the task. The instruction was to summarize the text using the 5W1H method: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. The reference answer got a score of 5, which means it included all relevant information without any irrelevancies.

Looking at the response to evaluate, I notice several issues. The user started by listing ""Quen,"" ""Cando,"" etc., which are the 5W1H categories. However, the content under each category seems to have some inconsistencies. For example, under ""Que,"" they mention ""miles de páxinas editadas"" which is correct, but later they ask ""Que tipo de páxina web é?"" which is a question, not a statement. This seems off-topic and not properly addressing the 5W1H elements. 

Also, there's a part that asks ""Cal é o nome deste espazo web?"" which is a question again, not a factual statement. The response includes questions instead of answers, which is not aligned with the 5W1H method. Additionally, the response mentions ""Desde cando está dispoñible este espazo web? Desde o día de hoxe."" Here, ""desde o día de hoxe"" might be incorrect since the text says ""desde o ano 1906"" for the publications, but the website was launched recently, so maybe the user is confused here. However, the main issue is the inclusion of questions instead of answers.

Another point is that the response includes redundant information. For example, under ""Por que,"" they repeat the same points as in ""Que"" and ""Como."" The reference answer was concise and included all necessary info without extra details. The evaluated response has parts that are not properly structured under the 5W1H categories, leading to redundancy and irrelevant content. 

Also, the response includes phrases like ""En canto ao contido,"" which is a transition phrase not covered in the 5W1H method, indicating a possible deviation. The presence of questions instead of statements violates the structure required for a summary. Therefore, based on the rubric, this response includes irrelevant and redundant information, leading to a lower score. The rubric penalizes summaries with irrelevant info, so this response would likely score around a 2 or 3. However, since it's structured but has issues, maybe a 2. But wait, the user mentioned the reference answer had a 5, so the evaluated response has significant issues, so perhaps a 2.
[/INST]

The response includes irrelevant and redundant information, such as questions (""Que tipo de páxina web é?"") and repetitive statements under different categories (e.g., ""Por que"" and ""Que"" overlap). It also introduces metalinguistic phrases like ""En canto ao contido,"" which are not part of the 5W1H method. These elements deviate from the requirement to succinctly address the 5W1H categories without excess or irrelevant content. [RESULT] 2",2.0
salamandra-5w1h," (Relevance of content selection) The response includes some relevant information, such as the entity (OSIMGA), the date, and the purpose of the publication. However, it also includes redundant information like the repetition of ""Galicia reduce a súa fenda dixital"" and incomplete sentences. Additionally, it fails to address the ""how"" and ""why"" aspects comprehensively, and the response lacks the structured 5W1H format. [RESULT] 3
[/INST] [INST] Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the 5W1H method using the provided rubric. First, I need to recall the instruction: summarize the text using what, who, when, where, why, and how. 

Looking at the response to evaluate, I see it starts with ""Quen? A sociedade..."" which is addressing the 'who' part. Then it mentions ""Cando? Este luns"" for 'when', and ""Onde? Non especifica."" for 'where'. The 'why' is addressed as ""Para publicar os datos..."" and 'how' as ""Mediante un comunicado de prensa."" However, the rest of the response is a continuation of the original text without proper 5W1H structure.

The reference answer (score 5) uses the 5W1H method effectively, covering all elements and providing concise, relevant info. The rubric emphasizes relevance, penalizing redundancy, metalinguistic phrases, and subjective opinions. 

In the evaluated response, there's repetition of ""Galicia reduce a súa fenda dixital,"" which is a redundancy. Also, the 'where' part is incomplete. The 'how' is briefly mentioned but not fully elaborated. The response doesn't structure the entire summary around the 5W1H framework. It also includes incomplete sentences and part of the original text without summarizing it properly. 

According to the rubric, since the summary has both relevant and irrelevant info (like redundancy), it gets a score of 3. The feedback needs to point out these issues without being too harsh, as the user wants strict adherence to the rubric.

(Relevance of content selection) The response includes some relevant elements (e.g., OSIMGA as the source, the date, and the purpose of data publication) but fails to structure the summary using the full 5W1H framework. It repeats key phrases like ""Galicia reduce a súa fenda dixital"" unnecessarily, introduces incomplete sentences, and omits critical details such as the urban-rural and age-based digital divide. The ""how"" section is minimally addressed, and the summary lacks a clear, organized 5W1H structure. [RESULT] 3",3.0

salamandra-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the 5W1H method using the given rubric. First, I need to understand what the 5W1H method entails: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. The reference answer scored 5, so I should compare the evaluated response against that.

Looking at the response to evaluate, it lists several points under each of the 5W1H categories. However, there are some issues. For example, under ""Por que"" (Why), the response says ""Para evitar que chegue a Madrid,"" which is not directly stated in the original text. The original text mentions that the package was intercepted before it reached Madrid, but the reason for sending it wasn't specified. So this might be an assumption rather than a fact from the text, which could be a problem for relevance.

Also, the response repeats some information. For instance, ""Quen"" (Who) is mentioned twice, once for the Mossos d'Esquadra and again for the president. This repetition might be considered redundant. Additionally, there's a mention of ""Como"" (How) in two different contexts, which could be overlapping or redundant.

The rubric emphasizes that the summary should include only important information without redundancies or subjective opinions. The response includes some subjective phrases, like ""Esta xente busca o seu minuto de gloria"" from the original text, but the user's response doesn't include that. Wait, actually, the original text has Díaz Ayuso saying ""A importancia que ten é ningunha"" which is a quote, but the response doesn't include that. However, the rubric penalizes subjective opinions not part of the original text. The response seems to avoid that, so maybe that's okay.

Another point is that the response includes ""Como: Mediante controis de correos"" which is accurate, as the interception was done by Correos. But then later mentions ""Como: Nun segundo envío,"" which might be confusing. It's possible that the second ""Como"" refers to the method of the second package, but the phrasing could be clearer.

The reference answer is concise and includes all relevant points without redundancy. The evaluated response has some repeated elements and possibly adds inferred reasons. The rubric says that if the summary includes irrelevant or redundant info, it gets lower scores. Since the evaluated response has some redundancy and maybe some inferred reasons not in the text, that would lower the score. However, it does cover all the necessary 5W1H points, so it's not completely off. The score rubric indicates that a score of 3 would be a mix of relevant and irrelevant info, which seems to fit here. Therefore, the final score would be 3.
[/INST]

The response attempts to address all 5W1H elements but includes redundant information and inferred explanations not explicitly stated in the source. For example, ""Para evitar que chegue a Madrid"" (Why) is an assumption rather than a direct fact from the text. Additionally, repetitive entries under ""Quen"" and ""Como"" introduce redundancy. While the core information aligns with the source, these issues reduce clarity and relevance. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric is about relevance—whether the summary includes only important information from the source, without redundancies, subjective opinions, or metalinguistic phrases.

First, I'll check the response to evaluate. The user's summary mentions the key points: the murder of Jimmy, the 40+ arrests, the groups involved (Frente Atlético, Ultra Boys), the charges against them, the police operation Neptuno, the political controversy, and the impact on the football community. It avoids including too many details like specific names of individuals unless necessary. However, I notice that the response includes some specifics like the taxista from Parla being considered a suspect, which is relevant. 

Now, comparing to the reference answer (score 5), which is concise and includes all critical elements without extra info. The evaluated response seems to cover all necessary points without redundancy. It doesn't add subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases. The mention of ""dúas semanas despois"" and the number of arrests aligns with the original text. However, the response does mention ""moitos membros ou ex membros de forzas de seguridade,"" which is accurate but perhaps slightly more detail than needed. But since it's part of the original content, it's still relevant. 

I should check if there's any irrelevant information. The response talks about the political fallout, which is part of the original text. It also mentions the ""peche da bancada"" which is a key point in the source. The reference answer includes similar points. 

No metalinguistic phrases like ""Here is the summary:"" are present. The evaluated response starts with the main topic. 

So, based on the rubric, the summary is mostly relevant, maybe a bit on the detailed side but not redundant. The reference answer is a 5, so if the evaluated response is slightly less detailed but still relevant, it might be a 4. Wait, but the rubric says score 5 is all information relevant. The evaluated response doesn't have any irrelevant info, so it might be a 5. Wait, but the reference answer is the example of a 5. Let me recheck.

The evaluated response includes all key points without adding opinions. The reference answer also includes all key points. The evaluated response doesn't have any irrelevant details. Therefore, it should be a 5. But wait, the rubric says that if there's a metalinguistic phrase, it's penalized. The evaluated response starts with ""Resumo:"" which is ""Summary:"" in Portuguese. The rubric mentions penalizing phrases like ""Here is the summary:"" which is similar. So, the presence of ""Resumo:"" might be a penalty. The reference answer doesn't have that, so maybe the evaluated response loses a point here. 

So, if the rubric penalizes metalinguistic phrases like ""Here is the summary:"", then the evaluated response's use of ""Resumo:"" would be a penalty, leading to a lower score. However, the user's instruction says that the response to evaluate is the one provided. In the given case, the response starts with ""O texto relata..."" and then ""Resumo:"" followed by the summary. The rubric says to penalize phrases like ""Here is the summary:"", so ""Resumo:"" would be a metalinguistic phrase, which would subtract a point. The reference answer doesn't have this, so it's a 5. Therefore, the evaluated response has a metalinguistic phrase, leading to a score of 4. 

But wait, in the reference answer, is there a similar structure? The reference answer starts with ""A primeira fase..."" without a heading. So, the presence of ""Resumo:"" is a problem. Therefore, the evaluated response would get a 4 because of that. Additionally, the evaluated response includes more details like ""dúas semanas despois"" which is correct, but the reference answer also mentions ""dúas semanas despois"". So, the main issue is the ""Resumo:"" line. Therefore, the feedback would note that the use of ""Resumo:"" is a metalinguistic phrase, leading to a score of 4.

Okay, let's start by looking at the response to evaluate. The task is to summarize a text about the disagreement between Spain and Portugal regarding the Atlantic railway connection between Lisbon and Vigo. The reference answer scores a 5, so I need to compare the evaluated response to that.

First, I'll check the relevance of the information in the evaluated response. The response mentions Spain's lack of interest, the opposition from Sergio Vázquez Torrón, the refusal to fund the study in 2021, the government's blame on previous administrations, and the cost of 200 million euros. It also covers Ana Abrunhosa's statements about Spain's pressure on Portugal, the focus on the north (Lisbon, Porto, Vigo), the resolution from the Iberian Summit, Portugal's investment plans, Nuno Santos' comments on economic ties, the importance of the southern exit from Vigo, and the funding details from the investment plan.

Comparing this to the reference answer, the evaluated response includes all key points: Spain's non-interest, the specific actions by Spanish officials, the cost, the pressure on Portugal, Portugal's priorities, the summit resolution, and funding sources. However, the evaluated response might have some extra details like the mention of the 55-minute travel time reduction and the specific funding amounts (4.5 billion for Lisbon-Porto, 900 million for Braga-Valença), which are present in the original text. The reference answer also includes these, so it's not redundant here. 

I should check if there are any subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases. The evaluated response seems to stick to factual statements without adding personal opinions. There's no phrase like ""Here is the summary:"" which would penalize. 

Now, checking the rubric: Score 5 is for all information being relevant. The evaluated response includes all critical elements from the source without unnecessary details. The reference answer also includes the same points, so the evaluated response meets the criteria for a 5. However, maybe the evaluated response includes more specifics than necessary? For example, the exact cost figures (4.5 billion, 900 million) might be considered detailed but are part of the original text. Since the rubric penalizes excess info, but in this case, those numbers are essential for accuracy. 

Since the evaluated response captures all relevant points without adding irrelevant information or subjective opinions, it aligns with the reference answer's structure and content. Therefore, the score should be 5.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the provided rubric. The rubric focuses on relevance—whether the summary includes only important information from the source, avoids redundancies, metalinguistic phrases, and subjective opinions not in the original text.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer is a 5, so it's the best example. The response to evaluate is the one I need to check.

Looking at the response: It starts by mentioning Irene, her age, the date, location, and the reason for the aggression (collecting signatures for Porto Cabral). It includes the key points about her interaction with the men, the physical aggression, the police intervention, and her legal actions. It also touches on the broader campaign, the opposition, and the employment promises. 

Now, checking for relevance. The response includes all main points: the incident, the details of the aggression, the police involvement, her legal considerations, and the context of the campaign. However, it might have some minor details. For example, the reference answer mentions the specific location (Praza da Independencia), the 300 meters of communal forest, the opposition from the community, and the legal aspects of the project. The response covers these but maybe not as comprehensively. 

Wait, the response says ""macrocentro Porto de Cabral"" while the reference answer says ""Porto Cabral."" That's a minor discrepancy, but not a major issue. Also, the response mentions ""4.000 empregos"" which the reference has ""4 mil postos de traballo."" These are equivalent. 

I need to check if there are any subjective opinions. The response states that Irene considers the violence was due to being a woman and younger, which is her opinion. The reference answer also includes that, so it's part of the original text. So that's okay. 

Are there any metalinguistic phrases? The response starts with ""Irene, unha viguesa..."" which is just stating the facts, not a metalinguistic phrase. So that's fine. 

The response includes all the important info without adding extra details. It's concise but covers the main points. The reference answer is more detailed, but the response here is still relevant. So according to the rubric, if all information is relevant, it's a 5. However, maybe the response misses some specific details, like the exact location (Praza da Independencia) and the 300 meters of forest. But the response does mention ""macrocentro comercial Porto Cabral"" which is the main point. 

Alternatively, maybe the response is missing the part about the community assembly opposing the project. The reference answer mentions that, but the response doesn't. That could be a point against. But the rubric is about relevance, not completeness. If the response includes what's necessary for the summary without irrelevant info, it's still relevant. 

So, considering all, the response includes the essential elements: who, what, when, where, why, and the consequences. It doesn't add extra info, and it's all relevant. Therefore, it should get a 5. However, I need to check if there's any redundancy or irrelevant info. The response seems to be concise. The reference answer has more details, but the response here is still relevant. So I think it's a 5.
[/INST]

(Relevance - the summary includes all essential information about Irene's aggression, the campaign for Porto Cabral, and the broader context without adding extraneous details.

The response effectively applies the 5W1H method to summarize the key points of the text without including irrelevant or subjective information. It accurately identifies the reduction in the digital divide in Galicia, the factors influencing the divide (habitat and age), the time frame (data from 2010 to 2011), the locations (urban vs. rural areas), the reasons (growth rate of internet adoption outpacing the national average), and the methods (increased internet subscriptions, broadband usage, and online shopping).

Okay, let's start by looking at the response the user wants evaluated. The task was to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response provided a summary with sections for What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. 

First, I need to check against the rubric. The rubric focuses on relevance—making sure the summary includes only important information and doesn't have redundancies or subjective opinions. The reference answer scored 5, so I should compare the evaluated response to that.

Looking at the response, it covers all the 5W1H points. It mentions the event (What), the organizers (Who), the date (When), location (Where), purpose (Why), and the method (How). The key details like the event name, location in Compostela, the number of projects selected (9 out of 14), the investment amount (4 million euros), and the list of notable projects are included. 

I should check if there are any irrelevant details. The response doesn't add any extra information beyond what's in the text. It also avoids subjective phrases like ""Here is the summary,"" which would have been penalized. The only thing I notice is that the response mentions the event took place on a past Friday but doesn't specify the exact date, which is okay since the original text only mentions ""pasado venres"" (last Friday). 

The reference answer also includes the 4 million euros and the list of projects, which the evaluated response includes. The structure is clear and follows the 5W1H format without any unnecessary information. There are no metalinguistic phrases, and the content is all relevant. Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 5.
[/INST]
The response effectively applies the 5W1H method, capturing all essential elements: event details (What/When/Where), participants (Who), purpose (Why), and methodology (How). It concisely summarizes key data (9 projects selected, 4 million euros needed) without redundancy or subjective additions. [RESULT] 5",5.0

gpt5-tldr," [INST] Alright, let me tackle this evaluation. First, I need to compare the response to the reference answer which scored a 5. The task is to check how well the response adheres to the rubric, focusing on relevance and avoiding irrelevant or redundant info.

Looking at the response, it mentions the launch of the portal, the number of monographs (350 since 1906), 200 available in PDF for free. It includes the Public Knowledge Project, management of texts, expansion of access, and specific contents like discourses, Terra Nomeada, etc. It also mentions the addition to periodic publications. 

Now, checking against the rubric. The reference answer includes all key points: the portal's launch, the number of documents, PDF availability, the project's goal, the attendees, and the available content. The response covers most of these without adding extra info. However, it's missing some details like the exact date of the press conference (this Tuesday), the mention of the Boletín and other periodicals, and the specific names of the officials. 

But the response doesn't add irrelevant info. It's concise, includes all necessary details, and doesn't have metalinguistic phrases. It doesn't introduce subjective opinions. So according to the rubric, since it's mostly relevant, it should get a 4. The only minor point is that it misses some specific details, but overall, it's relevant and doesn't have the issues penalized in the rubric. So the score should be 4.
[/INST]

The response effectively captures the core elements of the original text, including the launch of the portal, the number of monographs (350 since 1906), the availability of 200 in PDF, the Public Knowledge Project, and the inclusion of specific content like discourses and Terra Nomeada. It avoids irrelevant details and subjective opinions, maintaining focus on factual information. However, it omits some specific details present in the reference answer, such as the press conference date, the names of all officials, and the mention of the Boletín and other periodicals. These omissions do not constitute irrelevance but slightly reduce comprehensiveness. [RESULT] 4",4.0

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. First, I need to check the relevance of the response. The reference answer scores a 5 because all information is relevant. The response to evaluate mentions the key points: the man stabbed his partner, the location, the severity of her injuries, the police involvement, and the community's response like the council sessions and protests. 

I should check if there are any irrelevant details. The response doesn't add any extra info beyond what's in the original text. It mentions the exact time (morning of Wednesday), the victim's name, the perpetrator's name and age, the location, the injuries, and the subsequent actions by the council and other groups. The reference answer also includes similar details, so the response is concise and covers all necessary points without redundancy.

No metalinguistic phrases like ""Here is the summary:"" are present. Also, there's no subjective opinion added. The response sticks to the facts from the original text. Therefore, according to the rubric, this should be a 5. The feedback should highlight that all info is relevant and there are no issues, hence the score of 5.

[INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric. First, I need to understand the instruction, the response, the reference answer, and the rubric.

The instruction was to summarize a text about digital divide in Galicia. The response provided is quite brief, just a couple of sentences. The reference answer is more detailed, covering multiple points like the reduction in digital divide, factors like urban-rural and age, usage statistics, growth rates, and specific examples like online purchases. 

Looking at the rubric, the key points are relevance—only important content, no redundancies, no subjective opinions. The response to evaluate is very concise. It mentions that Galicia is reducing its digital divide and is approaching convergence with state indicators but still behind the Spanish average. However, it doesn't include details about urban-rural differences, age groups, specific percentages, or growth rates. These are important points from the original text. 

The reference answer includes all these details, so it's more comprehensive. The response here is missing most of the specific data and factors that the original text highlights. Therefore, it's not capturing all the relevant information. According to the rubric, Score 1 would be if the summary is the original text or irrelevant, but this isn't the case. Score 2 is for a lot of irrelevant info, but the response is too short. Score 3 is a mix of relevant and irrelevant, but the response has very little. Since it's missing key points, maybe Score 2? Wait, the rubric says Score 2 is when there's a large amount of irrelevant info, but the response is too brief. However, since it's missing important info, maybe it's not scoring well. Wait, the rubric's Score 5 is all relevant, and lower scores penalize for irrelevant or missing info. The response is missing most of the relevant info, so it's not including important details. Therefore, according to the rubric, this might be a Score 2 because it's missing a lot of relevant info. But wait, the rubric's Score 2 is ""contains a large amount of irrelevant information,"" but the response here is not including relevant info. So maybe it's not a fit. Alternatively, since it's too short and misses key points, perhaps it's a lower score. The rubric doesn't have a score for missing relevant info, but maybe the Score 2 is when the summary has a lot of irrelevant, but in this case, the response is too brief. Maybe the correct score is 2, but I need to check again. The response is only two sentences, which is very short. The reference answer covers multiple aspects. The response only mentions the main point about digital divide and being behind Spain. So it's missing the detailed factors like urban-rural, age, specific stats, growth rates, etc. Since the rubric penalizes for not including important info, this might be a Score 2. But wait, the rubric's Score 2 is when there's a lot of irrelevant info, but here the summary is too short. Maybe the correct score is 2 because it's missing most of the relevant information. Alternatively, perhaps it's a Score 1, but the original text isn't being copied. Hmm. I think the correct score is 2, as the response lacks significant relevant details. So the feedback would note that it's too brief and misses key points like urban-rural, age, specific percentages, etc., leading to a Score 2.
[/INST]

(Feedback for relevance: The response captures the main point about Galicia reducing its digital divide and being behind the Spanish average, but it significantly omits critical details like urban-rural disparities, age-based differences, specific statistical figures, and growth rates mentioned in the original text. These elements are central to the source material and are absent, making the summary insufficiently comprehensive.) [RESULT] 2",2.0

[/INST] [INST] Alright, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided an instruction to summarize a text about the US presidential election results and legal challenges. The response to evaluate is a list of keywords, while the reference answer is a proper summary. The rubric focuses on relevance, selecting important content without redundancies or subjective opinions.

First, I'll check if the response includes relevant information. The response is just a list of keywords like ""Estados Unidos, Biden, Trump, eleccións..."" This doesn't form a coherent summary. The reference answer includes key points: uncertainty about the president, Biden's lead, Trump's legal actions, and the states involved. The response misses all these elements. 

Next, I need to see if there are any irrelevant details. Since it's a list of keywords, there's no real content, so it's not adding anything. The rubric also mentions penalizing for phrases like ""Here is the summary:"" but the response doesn't have that. However, the main issue is that it's not a summary at all. It's just keywords. 

Looking at the rubric scores: Score 1 is for summaries that are the original text or irrelevant info. Score 2 is for a lot of irrelevant info. Here, the response is entirely irrelevant because it's not a summary. Therefore, the score should be 1. 

I should make sure I'm not missing any other rubric points. The response doesn't have subjective opinions, so no penalty there. The main problem is the lack of a coherent summary. Hence, the feedback and score are appropriate.
[/INST]

(Evaluate relevance of the content selected) The response consists solely of a list of keywords rather than a coherent summary, omitting critical information such as the uncertainty over the presidency, Biden's lead in key states, Trump's legal challenges, and the significance of electoral votes.

###Feedback: The response uses the 5W1H method effectively, addressing each component with concise and relevant information. It correctly identifies the key elements such as what, who, when, where, why, and how, without including unnecessary details. The information provided is focused on the main points of the source text, ensuring that each section is directly related to the content. However, the structure could be slightly improved for clarity, but this does not affect the relevance of the content. [RESULT] 5
[/INST]
[/INST] [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the response based on the provided rubric, which focuses on relevance—ensuring the summary includes only important information from the source and avoids redundancies, subjective opinions, or metalinguistic phrases.

First, I'll look at the response to evaluate. The response uses the 5W1H structure: What, Who, When, Where, Why, How. Each section is addressed with concise points. For example, under ""Que,"" it lists the connection between Lisbon and Vigo. Under ""Quen,"" it names the relevant government officials. The ""Cando"" section mentions the specific event date and time. ""Onde"" covers the locations involved. ""Por que"" explains the opposition and priorities. ""Como"" details the government's stance and the Portuguese plan.

Now, checking for relevance: The response doesn't include any subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases. It sticks to factual information from the text. The information is concise and directly tied to the source. There's no unnecessary detail. For instance, it doesn't elaborate on the political tensions beyond what's necessary for the 5W1H framework. 

However, the rubric also mentions penalties for redundancy or irrelevance. I need to check if there's any repetition or off-topic content. The response seems to cover all necessary aspects without overlap. The structure is clear, and each section addresses the required elements without adding extra info. 

Comparing it to the reference answer (score 5), the response is more structured and direct. The reference answer provides a narrative, while the evaluated response is more fragmented but still relevant. Since the rubric prioritizes relevance over structure, the response's focus on key points without fluff would likely score high. 

No subjective opinions are present, so no penalty there. The summary is concise, avoiding phrases like ""Here is the summary."" Therefore, it meets the criteria for a score of 5. The structure could be slightly improved, but that's a stylistic choice, not a relevance issue. Hence, the final score is 5.

Summarize the following text using the 5W1H method (what, who, when, where, why and how).

###Response to evaluate:
What: A series of demonstrations against the murder of Samuel Luiz, an 24-year-old nurse from Meicende (Arteixo), who was killed by a group of people using a baton.

Who: Samuel Luiz, an 24-year-old nurse from Meicende (Arteixo).

When: On the early morning of July 3rd.

Where: In A Coruña, near the Hotel Riazor.

Why: To denounce the murder and demand clarity on whether it was a homophobic crime, as indicated by friends and witnesses of the victim.

How: The murder occurred when a group of people used a baton to attack the victim, resulting in fatal injuries.

###Reference Answer (Score 5):

A vítima, que foi asasinada o 3 de xullo na Coruña, era veciña de Meicende e tiña 24 anos. Aínda non hai información de detencións por estar baixo secreto de sumario. As concentracións están convocadas nas sete grandes cidades e en Allariz, Monterroso, Camariñas, Noia, Rebeira, Cambre, Foz, Arteixo, Lalín, Vilalba, Bertamiráns, Xinzo e Betanzos.

###Score Rubrics:
[Relevance - selection of important content from the source. The summary should include only important information from the source document. Penalize summaries that contain redundancies and excess information. We also penalize phrases metalinguistic phrases generated by the model, such as 'Here is the summary:' (-1). Finally, we also penalize the presence of subjective opinions if they are not part of the original text (-1)]
Score 1: The summary is the original text or only contains irrelevant information. 
Score 2: The summary contains a large amount of irrelevant information.
Score 3: The summary contains a mix of relevant and irrelevant information.
Score 4: The summary contains mostly relevant information.
Score 5: All information in the summary is relevant.

llama3-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's start by understanding the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the 5W1H method using the provided rubric. First, I need to check if the response covers all the required elements: what, who, when, where, why, and how. 

Looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions ""O novo presidente dos Estados Unidos"" which answers 'who' and 'what'. Then it says ""O candidato do Partido Demócrata, Joe Biden"" which is 'who'. ""Un día despois das eleccións"" covers 'when'. ""Nos Estados Unidos"" is 'where'. The 'why' part is covered by ""porque aínda non se conta o voto anticipado e o voto por correo"", and the 'how' is addressed by ""porque Joe Biden está gañando nos estados pendentes"".

But wait, the rubric emphasizes relevance and avoiding subjective opinions. The response seems to use phrases like ""porque"" which might be considered metalinguistic. Also, does it include all necessary information from the reference answer? The reference answer includes more details about the states where the recount is ongoing and Trump's legal challenges. The response to evaluate is quite brief and might miss some of these points. 

I need to check if the response has redundant or irrelevant info. It seems concise but perhaps lacks some elements. The reference answer has a score of 5, so the response to evaluate might not meet that. Let me see the rubric again. Score 5 requires all info relevant. If the response misses some key points, it would get lower. The response doesn't mention the states like Michigan, Wisconsin, or the legal challenges, which are crucial. So it might be missing important info. Also, the use of 'porque' might be considered subjective or metalinguistic, but I'm not sure. 

Overall, the response is relevant but incomplete. It covers the basics but lacks depth. According to the rubric, this might be a 3 or 4. But since it's missing some key elements, maybe a 3. Wait, the rubric says score 4 is mostly relevant, and 5 is all. Since it's missing some important info, maybe it's a 3. But I need to be precise. The response doesn't mention the legal challenges or the specific states where the recount is happening, which are important. Therefore, it's missing some key points. Hence, the score would be 3.
[/INST]

(Feedback for criteria) The response covers the basic elements of the 5W1H method but misses critical details such as the specific states involved in the recount (e.g., Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada) and the legal challenges initiated by Trump. It also lacks information on the current vote counts (253-214) and the required 270 electoral votes. While it includes relevant information, it omits key contextual details that the reference answer explicitly provides, leading to an incomplete summary. Additionally, the use of ""porque"" (why) and ""porque"" (how) feels repetitive and slightly subjective, though not outrightly incorrect. [RESULT] 3",3.0

llama3-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing objective feedback based on specific criteria. The main goal is to assess the response strictly according to the given score rubric, which focuses on relevance and selection of important content.

Looking at the instruction, the task is to summarize the provided text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate uses the 5W1H structure but might have issues with relevance. The reference answer scores a 5, which means it includes all relevant information without redundancy or subjective opinions.

Now, examining the response: It covers the 5W1H points. ""Que"" (What) mentions the envelope with bullets and the interception of another. ""Quen"" (Who) lists the two recipients. ""Cando"" (When) states the day. ""Onde"" (Where) includes both cities. ""Por que"" (Why) notes the unknown author and motives. ""Como"" (How) explains the detection process and the second interception. However, the response includes some details that might not be essential, like the mention of the PP and the specific mention of ""minuto de gloria"" from Díaz Ayuso. The reference answer doesn't include these subjective quotes, which were part of the original text but might be considered opinions. Also, the response starts with a phrase like ""A continuación, te presento o resumo..."" which is metalinguistic and could be penalized. The reference answer doesn't have such phrases. 

Checking the rubric, Score 5 requires all information to be relevant. The response includes some subjective elements and extra phrases, which might lower its score. The reference answer is concise and sticks to factual information without adding opinions. Therefore, the response might score lower than 5. It's important to note that the response does cover the key points but has some non-essential elements. So, the feedback should point out the inclusion of subjective opinions and metalinguistic phrases, leading to a score lower than 5. The final decision would be a 4, as it's mostly relevant but has minor issues.
[/INST]

The response correctly applies the 5W1H structure and includes most relevant information about the intercepted envelopes, recipients, location, timing, and investigative actions. However, it includes subjective phrases like ""Esta xente busca o seu minuto de gloria"" from the original text, which are not neutral facts and may introduce bias. Additionally, it adds minor redundancies (e.g., repeating ""envío"" multiple times) and includes metalinguistic phrases like ""A continuación, te presento o resumo..."" which are not part of the source. These elements slightly reduce relevance. [RESULT] 4",4.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric is about relevance—ensuring the summary includes only important information from the source and avoids redundancies or subjective opinions.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer scores a 5, so it's the benchmark. The response to evaluate uses the 5W1H method, covering who, when, where, why, and how. It mentions Irene, the date, location, the reason for the aggression, and the events leading up to it. However, it stops short of detailing the full sequence of events, like the police intervention and the broader context of the campaign. 

Now, checking for relevance: The response includes key points about Irene, the date, location, and the cause of the aggression. But it misses some critical details from the original text, such as the police's involvement, other victims, and the campaign's context. The reference answer includes all these elements, which are essential for a comprehensive summary. 

The evaluated response doesn't mention the police arriving later, the other victims, or the campaign's broader impact. These are important because they provide context and show the wider implications of the event. Also, the evaluated response doesn't include the part where Irene plans to take legal action, which is a significant point from the original text. 

However, there are no subjective opinions added, so that's good. The response sticks to the facts as presented. But since it omits important details, it's missing the full picture. According to the rubric, a score of 4 would mean mostly relevant info, but there's missing key elements. However, the response doesn't have irrelevant info, so maybe it's more like 4. Wait, the rubric says 5 is all relevant. Since the evaluated response is missing some important parts, maybe it's a 4. But I need to check if the missing info is considered relevant. The police intervention and other victims are crucial. So, the response is missing important info, hence not fully relevant. Therefore, the score might be 4 because it's mostly relevant but lacks some key points. Wait, but the rubric for 4 says ""mostly relevant information,"" and 5 is all relevant. So if the response is missing some important info, but not irrelevant, it would be a 4. But the reference answer includes all, so the evaluated response is missing parts, thus lower than 5. So, the score should be 4.
[/INST]
The response addresses the 5W1H elements but omits key details present in the reference answer, such as the broader context of the campaign, the police intervention, other victims, and Irene's legal actions. While it focuses on direct events, it lacks critical information about the community's opposition, the legal implications, and the systemic issues highlighted in the original text. However, it avoids subjective opinions and irrelevant content. [RESULT]4",4.0
llama3-5w1h," [INST] Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the given rubric. The instruction was to summarize the text using the 5W1H method. The response provided by the assistant uses the 5W1H structure but seems to have some issues.

First, I need to check the rubric. The main focus here is relevance—ensuring that the summary includes only important information from the source and doesn't have redundancies or subjective opinions. The reference answer scores a 5 because it includes all relevant info without extra details. 

Looking at the response to evaluate: It lists ""Quen"" (Who), ""Medalla de bronce..."" (What), ""Sexto e derradeiro salto"" (When), ""Estadio Nacional de Toquio"" (Where), ""A súa mellor actuación..."" (Why), and ""Conseguiu o seu mellor salto..."" (How). 

But wait, the response has ""Quen"" repeated twice. That's a redundancy. Also, the answer might be missing some key points from the original text, like the fact that it's the first medal for a Galician athlete, the comparison with other athletes, and the personal best record. However, the response does cover the main elements of 5W1H. 

The rubric penalizes redundancies and metalinguistic phrases. The response has a repetition of ""Quen"" which is redundant. But the main issue is whether the information is relevant. The answer includes the essential who, what, when, where, why, and how. However, the reference answer includes more details like the first medal for Galician athletes and the world record, but maybe the response here is more concise. Wait, the user's rubric says that the summary should include only important information. The response might be missing some important details but doesn't have irrelevance. So according to the rubric, if the summary has redundant info but no irrelevance, it would be a 4? Wait, the rubric says that Score 5 is all relevant info. The response has redundancy (repeating ""Quen""), but the information itself is relevant. The rubric says that we penalize summaries with redundancies. So if there's redundancy, that would lower the score. The reference answer doesn't have that. 

So the response has a 1 point penalty for redundancy, but the information is still relevant. So the score would be 4? Or does the rubric have different levels? Let me check again. The rubric says: Score 5: All information in the summary is relevant. Score 4: Mostly relevant. So if there's some redundancy but not too much, maybe it's a 4. However, the rubric also mentions that we penalize summaries with redundancies and excess info. The response has redundancy but the information is correct. Therefore, the score would be 4, since the main info is relevant but with some redundancy. Alternatively, maybe the repetition of ""Quen"" is considered a metalinguistic phrase, but I don't think so. The rubric says to penalize metalinguistic phrases like ""Here is the summary:"" which isn't present here. So the main issue is the redundancy. Thus, the score is 4.
[/INST]

The response correctly identifies the 5W1H elements but includes a redundant repetition of ""Quen"" (Who), which introduces unnecessary duplication. While the core information (who, what, when, where, why, how) is relevant and aligns with the source, the redundancy slightly detracts from clarity. However, no irrelevant information is present, and all included details are factually accurate. [RESULT] 4",4.0

Okay, let me start by carefully reading the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The user provided an instruction, a response to evaluate, a reference answer with a score of 5, and the rubric. 

First, the instruction is about summarizing a news article about Galicia Baleira. The response to evaluate is a brief summary. The reference answer is longer but scores a 5, meaning it includes all relevant information without redundancy or subjective opinions.

Looking at the response to evaluate: ""A plataforma Galicia Baleira, impulsada pola Federación de Asociacións de Veciños de Lugo e a Federación de Asociacións de Veciños de Ourense (Limiar), foi presentada en Lugo e busca frear o despoboamento das zonas rurais."" 

This is a very concise summary. It mentions the key elements: the platform's name, the organizations behind it, the location of the presentation, and the main goal of stopping rural depopulation. However, it doesn't include details like the 23 proposals, the involvement of Teruel Existe, the specific measures mentioned (like microcredits, infrastructure, services), or the political aspects of engaging with parties. 

The rubric focuses on relevance—only including important content from the source. The response is brief but captures the core information. However, it might be missing some important points that the reference answer includes. For example, the reference answer mentions the 23 proposals, the provinces affected, the goal of having future generations live in rural areas, and the political engagement. 

But according to the rubric, a score of 5 means all information is relevant. Since the response doesn't include these extra details, but it does include the essential elements of who, what, where, and why, maybe it's still relevant. However, the reference answer includes more details, but the response here is more concise. Wait, the rubric says to penalize summaries with excess or irrelevant info. The response here is very brief but doesn't add any subjective opinions. The reference answer has more details, but the response here includes the main points. 

Wait, the rubric's score 5 is when all information in the summary is relevant. The response here doesn't have any irrelevant information, but it's shorter than the reference. However, the reference answer includes more details. But the task is to evaluate the response, not compare to the reference. The rubric says to check for relevance. Since the response includes the main points without adding anything irrelevant or subjective, it might still qualify for a 5. However, perhaps the response is too brief and misses some important elements that the reference includes. But the rubric doesn't mention length, only relevance. So if the response is entirely relevant, it should get a 5. The response doesn't have any subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases, so it's okay. Therefore, the score would be 5.

(1) The response succinctly captures the core elements of the initiative: the name (Galicia Baleira), the organizing entities (Federación de Asociacións de Veciños de Lugo and Ourense), the location (Lugo), and the primary goal (stopping rural depopulation). It avoids unnecessary details and remains focused on essential information. [RESULT] (5)  
(2) The summary does not include additional context such as the 23 proposals, specific policy measures (e.g., microcredits, infrastructure improvements), or the political engagement with parties, which are critical components of the original text. However, these omissions are not considered irrelevance but rather a deliberate brevity. [RESULT] (5)  
(3) The response does not introduce subjective opinions or metalinguistic phrases, adhering strictly to the factual content of the source. This aligns with the rubric’s requirement to exclude subjective interpretations not present in the original text. [RESULT] (5)  
(4) While the summary is concise, it includes all critical information necessary to understand the initiative’s purpose and scope without redundancy. The omitted details (e.g., political strategies, specific policies) are not deemed irrelevant but rather supplementary. [RESULT] (5)  
(5) The response fully meets the rubric’s criteria for relevance, accuracy, and absence of extraneous information. It provides a clear, focused summary without deviation from the source’s key points. [RESULT] (5)

Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. Let me start by understanding the task. The user provided an instruction about a news article regarding the Galician education ministry's decisions and a response to evaluate. The reference answer scores 5, and the rubric is about relevance—selecting important content without redundancies or subjective opinions.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The response mentions the criticism from the education community, the reduction of 109 units and 150 teachers, and the ministry's defense about having more units than before the pandemic. However, it's missing some key details from the reference answer. For instance, the reference includes the date (9 de agosto), the specific mention of ""xogar"" with numbers, the call for redoubling efforts, and the planned actions in September. The response doesn't include these details, which are crucial parts of the original text. 

Now, checking the rubric: Score 5 requires all information to be relevant. The response does include relevant points but omits important elements like the date, the critique of ""xogar"" with numbers, and the union's demands for action. These omissions mean the summary isn't fully capturing all relevant information from the source. The response is concise but lacks some critical details. 

However, it doesn't have irrelevant information. It doesn't add subjective opinions beyond what's in the original text. So, according to the rubric, it's missing some key points, which would lower the score. Since the reference answer includes all those details and scores a 5, the evaluated response might score a 4 because it's mostly relevant but misses some important elements. Alternatively, if the missing elements are considered significant enough to affect relevance, it might be a 3. But since the response isn't adding irrelevants, maybe it's a 4. Wait, the rubric says Score 4 is ""mostly relevant,"" so if some key info is missing, that's a 4. The response is concise and includes the main points but misses some specifics. Therefore, the score should be 4.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on relevance—ensuring the summary includes only important information from the source without redundancies, subjective opinions, or metalinguistic phrases. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer that scored a 5. The reference answer covers all key points: the date, time, perpetrator's background as a former candidate, the attack details, the victim's condition, the police response, and the local government's actions. It also mentions the various protests and statements from different groups. 

Now, checking the response to evaluate: it mentions the perpetrator (Javier M.), the victim (Montse López), the attack details (three stab wounds, one to the neck), the hospitalization, the police pursuit, and the local government's condemnation and session. It also notes the perpetrator's political history as a candidate. However, it doesn't mention the specific times of events like the council session or the subsequent protests, which are included in the reference answer. 

Wait, but the rubric says to penalize summaries with irrelevant info or redundancies. The response seems to have all the essential details without extra fluff. The reference answer includes more specifics about the timeline and the various community responses, but the response still captures the core incident and consequences. 

Is there any irrelevant information in the response? It doesn't mention the specific times of the protests or the exact locations beyond the main events. But those might be considered less critical than the core incident details. The response does include the perpetrator's political background, which is relevant as per the source. 

The reference answer includes the exact time the attack happened (9:00h) and the specific times of the council session and protests. However, the response doesn't mention those times, but that's okay because the rubric focuses on relevance, not completeness. As long as the core facts are there, it's acceptable. 

No subjective opinions are present in either the response or the reference answer. The response stays factual. Therefore, according to the rubric, the response is fully relevant, so it should get a 5.
[/INST]
(1) Relevance: The response includes all critical details about the incident, such as the victim (Montse López), the perpetrator (Javier M.), the nature of the attack (three stab wounds, one to the neck), the location (Unións Agrarias office), and the response from authorities (Garda Civil pursuit). It also highlights the perpetrator’s political background as a former candidate, which is relevant to the context. [RESULT] 5  
(2) Relevance: The summary avoids subjective language or metalinguistic phrases, focusing solely on factual information. It omits less critical details like specific protest times (e.g., 15:30h) but retains the core elements of the event. [RESULT] 5  
(3) Relevance: The response and reference answer both exclude non-essential information, such as extended quotes or speculative remarks. The summary is concise and directly tied to the incident’s timeline and consequences. [RESULT] 5

###The instruction to evaluate:
Ana Peleteiro conseguiu ser medalla de bronce no triplo salto feminino, obtendo así a primeira entrada no medalleiro de Toquio dunha atleta galega. A de Ribeira asinou coa súa participación de hoxe, a súa mellor actuación nun campionato e outorgoulle ao atletismo galego a súa primeira medalla olímpica. Peleteiro, que bateu a súa mellor marca por dúas veces consecutivas, mantivo unha pelexa ao límite, que se decidiu no sexto e derradeiro salto, coa xamaicana Rickets. Peleteiro só foi superada pola venezuelana Yulimar Rojas, que bateu a plusmarca do mundo, e a portuguesa Patricia Mamona. A galega chegou no seu primeiro intento até os 14.55, a só 7 centímetros da súa marca persoal, conseguida na pasada sexta feira para meterse na final, e logrou ir mellorando; tras dous saltos nulos, fixo os 14,87 metros que lle deron o metal. A discípula de Iván Pedroso fixo o mellor salto da súa carreira no Estadio Nacional de Toquio para situarse na elite deste deporte. Na súa primeira cita olímpica xa colocou o listón no bronce.
