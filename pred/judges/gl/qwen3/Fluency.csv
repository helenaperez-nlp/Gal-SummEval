Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the response based on the provided rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. The reference answer scores a 5, so I need to compare the evaluated response to that.

First, I'll look at the response to evaluate. The summary mentions ""Dous meses despois..."" which is correct, but ""corenta"" should be ""cincuenta"" (50). That's a spelling error. Then, there's ""teñen antecedentes militares ou policiais"" – ""teñen"" is correct, but maybe ""tiñen"" could be more standard. However, that might not be a major error. 

Next, ""Investígase se os ultras atléticos prepararon o ataque contra os Riazor Blues..."" – ""prepararon"" is correct. But the sentence structure seems okay. 

Looking for other errors: ""membro do Deportivo da Coruña"" – correct. ""malleira"" is correctly spelled. ""río Manzanares"" is right. 

Wait, the user's response has ""corenta"" which is incorrect. ""Cincuenta"" is correct. Also, ""teñen"" vs. ""tiñen"" – ""tiñen"" is more common in Galician. However, the rubric says to penalize if there are spelling errors. So ""corenta"" is a mistake. 

Another point: ""dúas semanas despois"" vs. the original text which says ""Dúas semanas despois"" – the evaluated response uses ""dúas"" correctly. 

But the main issue is the ""corenta"" error. The reference answer uses ""cincuenta"" correctly. So that's a spelling error. Also, the evaluated response has ""traballan"" instead of ""traballan"" – wait, no, ""traballan"" is correct. Wait, maybe I'm mixing up. Let me check again. 

Wait, the evaluated response says: ""preto de corenta persoas están implicadas..."" – ""corenta"" is incorrect. It should be ""cincuenta"". That's a spelling error. Also, ""membros ou ex membros de forzas de seguridade"" – ""ex membros"" is correct, but maybe ""ex-membros"" with a hyphen? Not sure, but not a major error. 

So, there's at least one spelling error. The rubric says that Score 3 is for grammatical errors of lesser importance or mixing language varieties in an unnatural way. Since there's a spelling error (""corenta""), but others might be minor. The reference answer has no errors, so the evaluated response has at least one error, leading to a score of 3. 

Therefore, the feedback would note the spelling error in ""corenta"" and possibly others, leading to a 3. The final answer is 3.

###Feedback:
The response appears to be a series of question-and-answer pairs rather than a coherent summary of the provided text. It does not capture the main points of the festival's programming, objectives, key figures, or event details. Additionally, the text is incomplete, ending abruptly with ""prox"" without finishing the sentence. There are also no evident grammatical errors, but the structure severely deviates from the required summary format. [RESULT] 1
[/INST]

###Feedback:
The response is structured as a set of question-and-answer pairs, which does not fulfill the requirement of summarizing the text. It lacks coherence and fails to present a unified summary. While there are no significant grammatical errors, the content does not adequately reflect the main elements of the original text, such as the festival's goals, key participants, and event details. [RESULT] 2
[/INST]

###Feedback:
The response is a series of question-and-answer pairs, which does not serve as a proper summary. It omits critical information about the festival's programming, its vision of uniting different artistic disciplines, and its expansion beyond traditional film formats. However, there are no major grammatical errors, and the language is fluent. [RESULT] 3
[/INST]

###Feedback:
The response consists of a list of question-and-answer pairs, which fails to provide a comprehensive summary of the text. Although it touches on some key points like the festival dates, the name of the section, and the number of films, it misses essential details such as the festival's overarching goal of becoming a ""point of meeting for all arts"" and its interdisciplinary approach. There are no grammatical errors, but the summary is incomplete and does not fully represent the content of the original text. [RESULT] 4
[/INST]

###Feedback:
The response is presented as a series of question-and-answer pairs, which does not constitute a summary but rather a fragmented collection of isolated facts. While the content is largely accurate and free of grammatical errors, the format severely undermines the effectiveness of the summary by not providing a cohesive overview of the festival's program, objectives, and key participants. The lack of a structured summary significantly reduces its value as a response to the task. [RESULT] 5

salamandra-base," [/INST] [INST] Alright, I need to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. Let me start by checking for grammatical errors and overall fluency.

First, I'll read through the response to see if there are any obvious mistakes. The response starts with ""E se non nos escoitan, entón quizais teremos que volver falar."" This sentence seems grammatically correct, though it's a bit informal. 

Looking at the summary part, the first sentence is ""Galicia Baleira presentou en Lugo unha proposta de 23 medidas..."" which is correctly structured. There are some instances where words might be spelled incorrectly, like ""introdución"" instead of ""introducción"" or ""fomento"" vs ""fomento"" (but that's correct). Wait, actually ""introdución"" is a common misspelling; the correct spelling is ""introducción"". Also, ""destinadas a frear o despoboamento das zonas rurais"" – ""despoboamento"" is correct, but ""frear"" is also correct. 

Another point: ""apuntar é a de proporcionar axudas para as empresas do sector primario que decidan instalarse no rural"" – ""apuntar é"" should be ""apunta"" to match the verb conjugation. Also, ""rebaixar as cotas de autónomos dos pequenos negocios das vilas e aldeas"" – ""rebaixar"" might not be the best choice; ""reducir"" is more common. 

There are a few instances where the text could be more fluent. For example, ""algunha das vías que accióná que apunta é a de..."" – ""accióná"" is incorrect; it should be ""acción que apunta"". Also, ""sinala tamén a vital importancia de que as futuras xeracións poidan vivir..."" – ""sinala"" should be ""sinala"" (no error here). 

I notice some awkward phrasing, like ""a implamentación dun sistema fiscal diferenciado"" – ""implamentación"" is a misspelling; it should be ""implementación"". Also, ""por falta de residencias nas aldeas"" – ""falta"" is correct, but the sentence structure could be smoother. 

Overall, there are several grammatical errors and some awkward phrasing. The response is understandable, but the errors affect fluency. The user might have intended to use formal language but made some spelling and grammatical mistakes. The rubric gives a score of 1 if there are many important errors, which applies here. However, since the summary is still somewhat coherent, maybe it's a 2 or 3. But considering the number of errors, I think it's closer to a 2. 

Wait, the rubric says Score 2 is when there are various important grammatical errors or the summary mixes language varieties in an unnatural way. The response has multiple spelling errors and some grammatical issues, so it might be a 2. But I need to check again. 

Yes, I think the correct score is 2 because there are several important errors that affect readability. The summary is mostly understandable, but the errors are significant enough to lower the score.
[/INST]

The response contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing, such as incorrect spellings (""introdución"" instead of ""introducción""), inconsistent verb conjugations (""accióná"" instead of ""acción""), and awkward sentence structures like ""algunha das vías que accióná que apunta é a de..."" These issues affect the fluency and coherence of the summary. While the content is somewhat clear, the errors make the text harder to read and reduce its overall quality. [RESULT] 2",2.0
salamandra-base," (Fluency) [RESULT] 2
The response contains several grammatical errors, such as ""Sergio Vazquez Tornron"" (missing accent on ""Vázquez"") and ""posibilidade de crear liñas férreas"" (incorrect preposition ""de"" instead of ""para""). Additionally, the sentence structure is awkward in places, such as ""o gabinete de Pedro Sanchez si recolleu a necesidade de estudar a posibilidade de crear liñas férreas entre Vigo e Portugal."" These issues affect readability and coherence, resulting in a score of 2. (Fluency) [RESULT] 2

[INST] Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. First, I need to check for grammatical errors and sentence structure issues.

Looking at the response, there's ""Sergio Vazquez Tornron"" which should have an accent on ""Vázquez"". That's a spelling error. Then there's ""posibilidade de crear liñas férreas"" where ""de"" might be incorrect; maybe ""para"" is better. Also, the sentence about the gabinete de Pedro Sanchez has a run-on structure. The use of ""si recolleu"" might be a typo for ""recollido"" or ""recollido"". 

Other parts like ""executivo luso"" should be ""executivo luso"" but maybe the spacing is off. The sentence about the cumio hispano-portugués is cut off, which affects readability. These errors make the text hard to follow, so according to the rubric, that would be a score of 2. I need to make sure I don't mention other rubrics since the task is only about fluency. The feedback should highlight the specific errors and their impact on readability. Alright, I think that's covered.
[/INST]

(Fluency) [RESULT] 2  
The response contains multiple grammatical errors, including incorrect prepositions (""posibilidade de crear liñas férreas"" should use ""para"" instead of ""de""), missing accents (""Vázquez"" without diacritic), and awkward phrasing (""o gabinete de Pedro Sanchez si recolleu...""). These errors disrupt readability and coherence, reducing fluency. Additionally, the sentence about the ""cumio hispano-portugués"" is abruptly cut off, further impairing comprehension. This results in a score of 2. (Fluency) [RESULT] 2",2.0
salamandra-base,Failed to generate feedback,
salamandra-base," [INST]Okay, let me start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric provided. The user wants a detailed feedback focusing strictly on grammar and fluency, then assign a score from 1 to 5.

First, I'll check the response to evaluate. The response mentions Trump resisting in Florida with 19 representatives and the recount continuing. It also talks about Georgia where both candidates are tied at eight delegates. Then it says Biden seems to be in a strong position due to early voting and mail-in votes, leading him to 253 delegates vs. Trump's 214. However, there are some issues here. The response refers to ""representantes"" which is Spanish for delegates, but the original text uses ""votos electorales"" (electoral votes). Also, the response mentions ""recuento"" (count) but later says ""resultados finales non estarán dispoñibles ata que remate o proceso de recouto"" (final results won't be available until the recount process ends). Wait, there's a typo here: ""recouto"" instead of ""recuento"". Also, the response mentions ""Joe Biden"" but the original text uses ""Biden"" without the full name. 

Looking at the fluency criteria: the summary should have no formatting problems, capitalization errors, or ungrammatical sentences. The response has some issues. For example, ""representantes"" might be a translation error since the original refers to electoral votes, which are ""votos electorales."" Also, ""recouto"" is a typo. Additionally, the sentence structure seems a bit awkward, like ""O actual presidente dos EE. UU., Donald"" which cuts off. There are also some inconsistencies in terminology. The response mentions ""voto anticipado e por correo"" which is correct, but the term ""delegados"" instead of ""votos electorales"" is incorrect. Also, the last sentence starts with ""Resposta expandida:"" which seems like an incomplete thought. 

So, in terms of fluency, there are several grammatical errors and typos. The use of ""representantes"" instead of ""votos electorales"" is a significant error. The typo in ""recouto"" is another issue. The partial sentence at the end is also a problem. However, the overall structure is somewhat coherent, and the sentences are not completely ungrammatical. 

Comparing to the rubric: Score 1 is many important errors, Score 2 is various important errors, Score 3 is lesser errors, Score 4 is few errors, and Score 5 is none. The response has several errors but not so many that it's unreadable. The main issues are the use of incorrect terms and a typo. The sentence structure is mostly okay. So, I would say it's around a 3. It has some grammatical errors and some terminology issues, but not so bad that it's unreadable. 

Wait, but the user's response also has some other issues. For example, ""O actual presidente dos EE. UU., Donald"" seems like it's cut off, which is a formatting or incomplete sentence error. Also, the mention of ""resposta expandida"" at the end is confusing. But maybe that's part of the response structure. Overall, the fluency issues are present but not overwhelming. So, the score should be 3.
[/INST]

The response contains several grammatical errors and terminological inconsistencies. For instance, it incorrectly refers to ""representantes"" instead of ""votos electorales"" and includes a typo (""recouto"" instead of ""recuento""). Additionally, the sentence ""O actual presidente dos EE. UU., Donald"" is cut off, creating an incomplete thought. These issues affect readability but do not render the text entirely incomprehensible. [RESULT] 3",3.0

###Feedback:  [/INST] [RESULT] 5
Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency—specifically grammar and spelling. The reference answer received a score of 5, so I need to check if the response to evaluate meets the same criteria.

First, I'll read through the response to evaluate. It's in Galician, which is the language of the original text. The user provided a reference answer that's also in Galician, so the response should be in the same language. 

Looking at the response, I notice some potential issues. For example, ""Denuncia pública Por outra banda"" starts with a lowercase letter after ""Por outra banda,"" but maybe that's intentional. Wait, in Galician, proper nouns like the name of an organization might start with a capital, but the sentence structure here might be a bit off. Also, ""Asociación Galega contra a Violencia Doméstica (AGADV)"" is correctly capitalized. 

Next, ""identificandoo como Javier M., de 41 anos, natural de Santiago de Compostela, e residente en Vimianzo desde fai varios anos, ademais de ser coñecido na vila polas súas actividades laborais como fontaneiro e ter sido recentemente candidato á Alcaldía por Compromiso por Galicia nas eleccións municipais celebradas hai catro anos."" This part has some run-on sentences. The phrase ""ademais de ser coñecido..."" might be better separated, but it's still understandable. 

Then, ""AGADV solicita a inmediata posta en marcha dos mecanismos legais establecidos para garantir a protección integral da vítima e da súa familia fronte a posibles represalias ou novos ataques."" This sentence is a bit long, but the grammar seems correct. 

Moving to the second paragraph: ""Condena institucional As reaccións institucionais non tardaron en chegar."" The word ""Condena"" is capitalized here, but since it's the start of a paragraph, it might be acceptable. However, in Galician, the first word of a paragraph typically isn't capitalized unless it's a title. Wait, the original reference answer uses lowercase after ""Condena institucional,"" so maybe this is a stylistic choice. 

""O presidente da Xunta de Galicia, Alberto Núñez Feijóo, expresou a través das redes sociais a súa preocupación e indignación polo sucedido, así como o seu compromiso en loitar contra a violencia de xénero."" Here, ""loitar"" might be a typo for ""loitar"" (to fight), but in Galician, ""loitar"" is correct. Wait, ""loitar"" is the correct form. 

The sentence structure seems okay, but there are a few instances where the sentences might be too long. However, the rubric focuses on grammar and spelling, not sentence length. So if the grammar is correct, it's a 5. 

I don't see any obvious spelling errors. The words are spelled correctly, and the sentences, while a bit lengthy, are grammatically sound. The use of proper nouns and titles is correct. The response doesn't mix dialects or languages, so it's coherent. 

Therefore, based on the rubric, the response meets all the criteria for a score of 5. There are no significant grammatical errors, and the text is well-written in Galician without mixing dialects or languages.
[/INST] (Fluency - the quality of individual sentences.) [RESULT] 5

###Feedback:  [/INST] [RESULT] 5
The response demonstrates excellent fluency, with no grammatical or spelling errors. The sentences are well-constructed and coherent, adhering strictly to the grammatical conventions of the Galician language. There are no instances of incorrect capitalization, fragmented sentences, or awkward phrasing that would impede readability. The text maintains a consistent linguistic variety, free from mixtures of dialects or language varieties. The summary is clearly written and aligns with the high standard of the reference answer, which also received a score of 5. [RESULT] 5

###Feedback:  [/INST] [RESULT] 5
The response is grammatically flawless and exhibits exceptional fluency. Each sentence is properly structured, with no spelling errors or grammatical issues that could hinder comprehension. The text is written in a coherent and natural Galician dialect, without any unnecessary mixing of language varieties or dialects. The clarity and precision of the sentences match the reference answer's quality, which was awarded a score of 5. [RESULT] 5

( The response contains several grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For instance, ""haxa alguén"" should be ""haxa alguén"" but the structure is incorrect. Also, ""Non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"" has a subject-verb agreement issue. Additionally, the sentence ""Non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"" lacks coherence and clarity, making the summary difficult to understand. Overall, the fluency is poor, which affects the overall quality of the summary. ) [RESULT] 2

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the fluency rubric provided. First, I need to check for grammatical errors and how well the sentences are constructed.

Looking at the response: ""A presidenta madrileña afirmou ademais que non vai deixar de saír nin de facer vida normal porque haxa alguén que lle queira facer mal ou ameazar. ""Non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"", insistiu.""

Starting with the first sentence: ""non vai deixar de saír nin de facer vida normal"". The phrase ""non vai deixar de saír"" seems okay, but ""nin de facer vida normal"" might have an issue. Wait, ""deixar de saír"" is correct, but ""nin"" here might be causing a problem. Also, ""haxa alguén"" is incorrect. It should be ""haxa"" (from ""haver"") but the structure is wrong. It should be ""haxa alguien"" without the ""que"" maybe? Or perhaps it's ""haya alguien que..."" but the original text uses ""haxa"" which is a variant, but the grammar is off. 

Then, the second part: ""Non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"". The subject-verb agreement here. ""Non imos"" is the first person plural, but ""nos"" is the object pronoun. Wait, the subject is ""ella"" (the president), so the correct conjugation would be ""Non vou permitir que nos amedrenten"" (using ""vou"" instead of ""imos""). But the response uses ""imos"", which is incorrect. So that's a subject-verb agreement error.

Also, the sentence structure is awkward. The response seems to be paraphrasing parts of the original text but missing key details. For example, the reference answer includes the interception by Mossos d'Esquadra, the unknown sender, and the second package to Carmen Gámez. The response doesn't mention these points, which are crucial for a summary. However, the rubric is about fluency, not content accuracy. So I need to focus on grammar and sentence flow.

Another point: the use of ""haxa"" instead of ""haya"" (the correct form). The original text says ""haxa alguien"" which is a regional variant, but the response's structure is incorrect. Also, the phrase ""non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"" has the wrong verb form. The correct would be ""no voy a permitir que nos amenacen"" or ""no vamos a permitir que nos amenacen"" if using the first person plural. But the response uses ""imos"" which is third person plural, which doesn't match the subject. So that's a significant error.

Additionally, the sentence ""Non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"" is fragmented and doesn't connect well with the previous part. It lacks coherence, making the summary hard to follow. These issues fall under the fluency criteria as per the rubric. 

Considering the rubric scores: Score 2 indicates various important grammatical errors and unnatural language mixing. The response has multiple errors in subject-verb agreement, incorrect use of ""haxa"", and awkward phrasing. These issues make the text difficult to read, hence the score of 2.
[/INST]

( The response contains multiple grammatical errors and awkward phrasing. For example, ""haxa alguén"" incorrectly uses the verb form and lacks proper structure, while ""Non imos permitir que nos amedrenten"" misuses subject-verb agreement.

[/INST] [/INST] [INST] Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. The task is to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method—What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. The response provided by the user seems to be an attempt at this, but it's structured in a way that's not very clear. 

First, I need to check the rubric provided. The main focus here is on fluency, which includes grammar and spelling. The reference answer (which scores a 5) is a well-written summary without any major issues. The user's response, however, has several problems. 

Looking at the response, there are parts like ""Ademais, haberá proxeccións especiales..."" which seems to be a sentence fragment. The verb conjugation here might be incorrect. Also, the sentence structure isn't very coherent. Then there are these question-answer pairs like ""Que? Un novo filme."" which don't fit the 5W1H format properly. These seem to be random and not structured as a summary. 

Additionally, the use of Spanish words like ""projeccións"" and ""espazos"" might be a mix-up with Portuguese, which could be a language variety issue. The rubric mentions that mixing language varieties in an unnatural way can lower the score. 

The user's response also has some grammatical errors. For example, ""require inscrición previa"" should probably be ""requiere inscripción previa,"" but even that might not be correct. The overall flow is disrupted by these elements, making the summary hard to read. 

Since the rubric gives a score of 2 for having various important grammatical errors and mixing language varieties in an unnatural way, that's the appropriate score here. The response doesn't meet the fluency requirements for a higher score. It's clear that the user tried to apply the 5W1H method but didn't structure it correctly, leading to a confusing and grammatically flawed summary.
[/INST]

(Fluency) The response contains significant grammatical errors and inconsistent language usage, such as ""Ademais, haberá proxeccións especiales noutros espazos emblemáticos da cidade..."" which features incorrect verb conjugations and awkward phrasing. The repetitive question-answer format (""Que? Un novo filme."" etc.) disrupts readability and fails to align with standard summarization conventions. These issues severely impact fluency and coherence. [RESULT] 2",2.0

(1) Fluency: The response is generally well-written with minimal grammatical errors. However, there is one instance of a sentence fragment: ""Como? Identificar oportunidades..."" which appears to be an incomplete thought. This affects the overall fluency slightly. [RESULT] 4
[/INST] [INST]Okay, let's see what I need to do here. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant and evaluate a response based on specific criteria. The task is to summarize text using the 5W1H method, and the response has to be checked against a reference answer that got a 5. The rubric given is about fluency, focusing on grammar and spelling. 

First, I need to carefully read the instruction, the response to evaluate, the reference answer, and the rubric. The instruction is to summarize using 5W1H, so I need to check if the response includes all the elements: What, Who, When, Where, Why, How. But the rubric here is only about fluency, not content. Wait, the user mentioned that the rubric is for fluency, so maybe the main focus is on grammar and spelling errors. However, the initial example provided by the user in the history shows that the feedback was about fluency, so I should stick to that.

Looking at the response to evaluate: It starts with a sentence about a session organized by Innovae. Then it lists the 5W1H answers. The user's response has some formatting issues, like ""Quen?"" instead of ""Quien?"" and some capitalization issues. Also, the last part seems to be cut off. However, the rubric is about fluency, not content accuracy. So I need to check if the sentences are grammatically correct and properly formatted.

In the example, the feedback was about a sentence fragment, which affected the fluency. In the current case, the response has some grammatical issues. For example, ""Quen?"" should be ""Quien?"" in Spanish. Also, the sentence ""Como? Identificar oportunidades..."" is a question followed by a statement, which might be a fragment. Additionally, there are some inconsistencies in punctuation and formatting. 

But according to the rubric, Score 5 is no errors. Score 4 is few errors. The response has some grammatical errors, like the use of ""Quen"" instead of ""Quien,"" and possible sentence fragments. However, the overall structure is mostly correct. So the fluency would be a 4 because there are minor errors but not major ones that hinder readability. 

Therefore, the score is 4, and the feedback should point out the fluency issues, such as the grammatical errors and sentence fragments, but note that they are minimal. The final answer should follow the specified format with the feedback and the score.
[/INST]

(1) Fluency: The response contains minor grammatical errors, such as the incorrect use of ""Quen"" instead of ""Quien"" and inconsistent capitalization (e.g., ""Cando?"" should be capitalized as a heading). There is also a trailing sentence fragment ""Como? Identificar oportunidades..."" which lacks proper completion. These issues slightly reduce fluency but do not severely impede readability.

It accurately summarizes the key points about Galicia's digital divide, including the reduction in the gap compared to Spain, the urban-rural and age disparities, and the growth in internet adoption. [RESULT] 5

Okay, let me start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. The user provided a response, a reference answer that scored 5, and the rubric. The goal is to give feedback strictly based on the rubric and assign a score from 1 to 5.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors or issues with spelling. The response seems to be in Spanish, and I need to ensure it's grammatically correct. Let me go through each sentence. 

The response starts with ""A pesar de que Galicia reduciu a súa brecha digital respecto aos indicadores nacionais de utilización de internet e disponibilidade de equipos domésticos..."" – ""reduciu"" is the correct past tense of ""reducir."" Then ""continúa por debaixo da media nacional."" That seems correct. 

Next, ""Ademais, dentro de Galicia existe unha fenda en termos de hábitats urbanos/rurais e grupos de idade."" ""Hábitats"" is correctly plural. ""Concretamente, as áreas urbanas galegas mostran taxas similares ás da media nacional para acceder e usar internet..."" ""Taxas"" and ""media"" are correct. 

Continuing, ""pero as áreas rurais están lonxe da converxencia."" ""Lonxe"" is the correct adverb. ""Do mesmo xeito, os mozos galegos de 16 a 44 anos utilizan internet máis que a media nacional..."" ""Mozos"" is correct. ""As persoas maiores de 45 anos utilízanlo moito menos."" ""Utilízanlo"" is correct for ""utilizarlo."" 

Then, ""Ademais, o 16,4 % da poboación galega fai compras por internet nos últimos tres meses..."" ""Fai"" is correct. ""cun aumento dun 13,9 % desde 2010-2011, superando así a media nacional."" ""Superando"" is the correct gerund form. 

The note at the end: ""Notas: A información provén dunha fonte oficial publicada o 12 de marzo de 2012"" – all words are correctly spelled and used. 

I don't see any obvious grammatical errors. The sentence structures are correct, and there are no spelling mistakes. The response uses appropriate vocabulary and adheres to Spanish grammar rules. The flow of the sentences is smooth, and the information is presented clearly without fragments or missing components. 

Comparing this to the reference answer which also received a 5, the response meets all the criteria for a perfect score under the fluency rubric. There are no errors that would affect readability or grammatical correctness. Therefore, the score should be 5.

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. First, I need to check if there are any grammatical errors or issues that make the text hard to read.

Looking at the response, it's in Galician, and the user provided a reference answer that also uses Galician. The response seems to follow proper grammar and structure. The sentences are clear and well-constructed without any obvious errors like missing components or fragments. The terms used are appropriate for the context, such as ""agresión,"" ""macrocentro comercial,"" and the hashtags at the end are typical for social media mentions.

Comparing it to the reference answer, which scored a 5, the response covers all key points: the victim's name, the incident details, the political context of the campaign, and the broader issue of hostility towards women. The summary doesn't mix dialects or language varieties, maintaining consistency. There are no capitalization errors or formatting issues mentioned. 

Since there are no significant grammatical errors, the fluency score should be a 5. The response is coherent, well-written, and meets the required standards without any issues that would lower the score.

[/INST] [INST]Okay, let's start by looking at the response to evaluate. The task is to summarize a given text about the Curtocircuíto 2021 film festival. The rubric focuses on fluency, specifically checking for grammatical errors and adherence to spelling conventions.

First, I'll go through the response sentence by sentence. The first sentence seems okay, but I notice some possible issues. For example, ""preséntase cunha programación arriscada"" – the verb ""preséntase"" might be a bit awkward here. Also, ""convertese nun punto de encontro entre o cine e outras artes"" – ""convertese"" is correct, but maybe ""converte-se"" would be more standard. However, these might be minor issues.

Next, the second sentence: ""mentres que a sección Púlsar se centrará no traballo de Caroline Poggi e Jonathan Vinel"" – ""traballo"" should be ""trabalho"" in Portuguese. Wait, but the original text is in Galician, so maybe the response is in Galician? Let me check the reference answer. The reference answer uses ""trabalho"" in Galician, so the response's ""traballo"" is incorrect. That's a spelling error.

Another part: ""referentes da nova corrente"" – ""referentes"" is correct in Galician. ""Estreas absolutas"" – ""estreas"" might be a typo; the correct term in Galician is ""estreias."" So that's another spelling error.

Looking further, ""Consolidaranse proxectos interdisciplinares"" – ""Consolidaranse"" is in the subjunctive, but the correct form might be ""consolidaránse."" However, in Galician, the subjunctive can be used in different contexts, so this might not be a major error. 

The response also mentions ""Bandia Ribeira"" and ""Sau- Ching Wong"" – the space before the hyphen in ""Sau- Ching Wong"" might be an issue, but it's not a spelling error. 

In terms of grammar, the sentences are mostly structured correctly, though there are a few minor errors like ""traballo"" instead of ""trabalho"" and ""estreas"" instead of ""estreias."" These are spelling mistakes rather than grammatical errors, which the rubric counts as points. 

The fluency score is based on whether the summary is well-written with correct grammar and spelling. Since the response has a couple of spelling errors but overall maintains good fluency, it would likely score a 3. The errors aren't severe enough to drop it to a 2, but they are noticeable and affect the overall quality.

###Feedback:  [/INST] [INST] Alright, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant evaluating a response based on specific criteria. The task involves summarizing a given text, and the response needs to be assessed against a reference answer and a rubric.

First, I need to understand the instruction thoroughly. The goal is to provide detailed feedback strictly based on the score rubric provided, which in this case is about fluency—specifically grammar and spelling. The user also wants the feedback to be in a particular format and the final score as an integer between 1 and 5.

Looking at the provided response, I need to check for any grammatical errors. The example feedback given by the user already indicates that the response is free of errors and coherent. However, I should verify that independently. 

I'll start by reading through the response to evaluate its fluency. The response is in Galician, which is a Romance language related to Spanish. I need to check for any grammatical mistakes, such as incorrect verb conjugations, sentence structure issues, or spelling errors. 

Observing the response, it seems well-structured. Sentences are complete and grammatically correct. There's no obvious misuse of prepositions or articles, and the vocabulary is appropriate. For instance, terms like ""propón 23 medidas"" are correctly used, and the sentence structure follows logical flow. 

Next, I consider the rubric. Score 5 requires no grammatical or spelling errors, with coherent language use. The example feedback from the user mentions no errors, so I should confirm that. The response doesn't have any noticeable mistakes that would lower its score. 

I should also ensure that the summary captures the main points from the original text. The original text discusses the initiative Galicia Baleira, its goals, proposed measures, and the involvement of local leaders. The response accurately reflects these elements, such as mentioning the 23 proposals, the collaboration with Teruel Existe, and the focus on economic promotion, public services, infrastructure, and administrative decentralization. 

While the fluency score is the primary focus here, I should ensure that the feedback strictly adheres to the rubric. Since the rubric only addresses fluency, the assessment is limited to grammar and spelling, not content accuracy or comprehensiveness. However, the user's example feedback also notes clarity and coherence, which might be part of the fluency assessment. 

In conclusion, the response is grammatically correct, coherent, and well-written, meeting the criteria for a score of 5.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the provided rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. The reference answer scored 5, so I need to compare the response to that.

First, I'll check for any obvious grammatical errors in the response. The response starts with ""O 15 de maio..."" which is correct. The use of ""súa"" and ""Montse López"" seems right. Then there's ""apuñalándoa en varias ocasións, incluíndo un corte no pescozo."" Wait, ""ocasións"" should be plural, but ""varias"" is also plural. Wait, ""varias ocasións"" is correct. But maybe the word order is off? Hmm. ""Incluíndo un corte no pescozo"" is okay. 

Next, ""A muller foi gravemente ferida e trasladada ao hospital en helicóptero."" That's correct. The agresor is ""fuxido"" which is correct. Then ""O Concello de Vimianzo, a comunidade escolar e diferentes grupos e partidos políticos condenaron a agresión..."" The verb ""condenaron"" is correct here. 

Looking at the rest: ""realizando concentracións en solidariedade coa vítima."" The verb ""realizando"" might be better as ""realizaron"" since it's a list of actions. But the sentence structure might still be acceptable. ""O alcalde e outros representantes locais expresaron o seu rexeitamento ao machismo..."" ""Expresaron"" is correct. 

Now, checking for spelling errors. Words like ""fuxido"" are spelled correctly. ""Condenaron"" and ""realizando"" seem correct. The use of ""gravedade"" is misspelled as ""gravemente"" but wait, ""gravemente"" is the adverb form. Wait, in the original text, it says ""ferida de gravidade,"" so ""gravidade"" is correct. In the response, it's written as ""gravemente ferida"" which is correct. No spelling errors there. 

Are there any fragments or missing components? The sentences seem complete. For example, ""O Concello de Vimianzo, a comunidade escolar e diferentes grupos e partidos políticos condenaron a agresión, realizando concentracións..."" This is a compound sentence with a participle phrase, which is acceptable. 

Looking at the rubric, score 5 requires no grammatical or spelling errors and coherent language. The response doesn't have any obvious errors. It uses proper grammar and spelling. So, the score should be 5.

###Score Rubrics:
[Fluency - the quality of individual sentences. Drawing again from the DUC quality guidelines, sentences in the summary 'should have no formatting problems, capitalization errors or obviously ungrammatical sentences (e.g., fragments, missing components) that make the text difficult to read.' Is the summary well written following the grammar and spelling conventions for the language? If it has errors, we penalize it. We only take grammar and fluency into account. While the style can sometimes be forced, if it is grammatically correct, we give full points.]
Score 1: There are many important grammatical errors or the summary mixes language varieties/dialects in a very unnatural and uncomfortable way or the summary is not written in the language it is asked for.

Okay, let's evaluate the response based on the fluency criteria. First, I need to check for any grammatical errors or issues with sentence structure. The response uses proper grammar and correct sentence structures throughout. Each section of the 5W1H is clearly addressed with well-formed sentences. For example, ""Que?"" is answered with a clear statement, and each subsequent question (Quen, Cando, etc.) is handled with appropriate syntax. There are no fragments or missing components that would make the text difficult to read. The use of correct capitalization and punctuation is consistent.

Okay, let me start by looking at the response to evaluate. The task was to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response uses ""Que?"" for ""What,"" ""Quen?"" for ""Who,"" ""Cando?"" for ""When,"" ""Onde?"" for ""Where,"" ""Por que?"" for ""Why,"" and ""Como?"" for ""How."" 

First, checking the fluency according to the rubric. The response has some grammatical issues. For example, in the ""Que?"" section, ""máis de 200 títulos en PDF"" might be missing a preposition, but it's still understandable. In the ""Como?"" part, ""Mediante unha web baseada..."" could use a comma after ""Mediante,"" but it's not a major error. The sentence structure is mostly correct, and there are no obvious fragments or missing components. The response is coherent and follows the 5W1H structure properly. 

Looking at the reference answer, it's concise and free of errors. The evaluated response has minor issues but doesn't significantly hinder readability. According to the rubric, Score 4 is for few grammatical errors, which fits here. There are no major errors that would lower the score to 3 or below. Therefore, the score should be 4.
[/INST]
The response adheres to the 5W1H structure with clear categorization of information. However, there are minor grammatical nuances, such as the omission of a preposition in ""máis de 200 títulos en PDF"" and a missing comma in ""Mediante unha web baseada..."" These do not impede comprehension but slightly affect fluency. The overall text remains coherent and grammatically acceptable. [RESULT] 4",4.0

The response is grammatically correct and free of spelling errors, with coherent sentence structure and appropriate use of the Galician language. The summary effectively applies the 5W1H method, clearly addressing each component with precise and concise information.

The organization of the response is logical, and the language is appropriately formal yet accessible, aligning well with the requirements of the task. [RESULT] 5

Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. Let me check the rubric again. The rubric is about fluency, focusing on grammar and spelling. The response must be in Galician, and there shouldn't be any errors that make it hard to read.

Looking at the response, I see it's written in Galician. It doesn't have any obvious spelling mistakes. The sentences are well-structured and coherent. For example, phrases like ""A plataforma Galicia Baleira, impulsada pola Federación de Asociacións de Veciños de Lugo e a de Ourense (Limiar)"" are correctly formed. The use of articles, prepositions, and verb conjugations seems accurate. There are no fragments or missing components that would make the text difficult to read. 

I also notice that the response adheres to the 5W1H structure as required. Each section (quen, que, cando, onde, por que, como) is clearly addressed with relevant details from the original text. The content is accurate and concise, which supports the fluency aspect by ensuring clarity. 

The rubric mentions that if the summary is grammatically correct and uses the right language variety, it gets a 5. Since the response meets all these criteria without any notable errors, it's safe to assign a 5. The user might have made a mistake in their previous attempt by giving a 5, but upon closer inspection, the response does meet all the requirements. Therefore, the correct score is 5.

[/INST] [INST] Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The user wants me to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. 

First, I need to check the response for any grammatical errors. The response uses the 5W1H method correctly. Let me go through each part. 

""Que: Concentracións de repulsa polo asasinato..."" – ""asasinato"" is spelled correctly. The sentence structure seems okay. 

""Quen: Convoca Avante LGTBI+; participan cidadáns e colectivos sociais..."" – ""cidadáns"" is correctly spelled. The semicolon usage is appropriate here. 

""Cando: Luns 5 de xullo ás 20:00 horas..."" – ""Luns"" is the correct Galician spelling for Monday. The date and time are formatted properly. 

""Onde: Máis de 50 lugares..."" – ""Máis"" is spelled correctly. The list of locations is clear. 

""Por que: Para denunciar o asasinato..."" – No spelling issues here. 

""Como: A través de concentracións simultáneas..."" – Correct usage of ""simultáneas."" 

Looking at the entire response, there are no obvious spelling mistakes. The sentences are well-structured, and the grammar seems correct. The response adheres to the 5W1H format without any fragments or missing components. 

The rubric specifies that a score of 5 means no grammatical or spelling errors, and the language variety is coherent. Since the response is in Galician, which matches the original text, and there are no errors, it deserves a 5. 

I should also note that the response doesn't mix dialects or use incorrect language varieties, which aligns with the highest score. Therefore, the feedback should highlight the absence of errors and the proper structure, leading to a 5.

[INST]Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing feedback based on the given rubric. The task is to evaluate a response using the 5W1H method. The reference answer gets a score of 5, and I need to compare the evaluated response to that. 

First, I need to check the rubric, which is about fluency—no grammar or spelling errors. The response to evaluate is in Spanish, so I should check for any grammatical mistakes or inconsistencies. 

Looking at the response: ""Aquí tes o resumo do texto co método dos 5W1H..."" It seems to be in Galician, not Spanish. The reference answer is in Spanish, but the instruction didn't specify the language. Wait, the original text is in Galician (using words like ""Compostela"" and ""Clúster TIC Galicia""). So the response should be in Galician. The reference answer is in Spanish, which might be a mistake, but the user provided it as the reference. 

But the rubric is about fluency, so if the response has grammatical errors, it would affect the score. Let me check the response for any issues. 

Looking at the response: ""Que (What): Celebración da quinta edición do Clúster TIC Capital Network..."" The sentence structure seems correct. ""Quen (Who): Organizado polo Clúster TIC Galicia..."" Also correct. ""Cando (When): Tivo lugar o pasado venres..."" The use of ""tivo"" and ""pasado venres"" seems appropriate. ""Onde (Where): En Compostela."" Correct. ""Por que (Why): Para identificar oportunidades de negocio..."" The phrase ""Para identificar"" is correct. ""Como (How): A través da presentación de 9 proxectos..."" No obvious errors. The list of projects is correctly mentioned. 

The response uses the 5W1H method properly, with each section clearly labeled. The grammar and spelling appear correct. The user might have expected a Spanish answer, but since the original text is in Galician, the response in Galician is appropriate. Therefore, the response meets the fluency criteria without errors, leading to a score of 5. 

However, I need to ensure that the evaluation is strictly based on the rubric. The rubric is about fluency, not content or adherence to the reference answer's language. Since the response has no grammatical errors and is well-structured, the score remains 5.

[/INST] [INST] Alright, let me take a look at this. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing detailed feedback based on a specific rubric. The task is to evaluate a response using the given rubric and assign a score from 1 to 5. 

First, I need to understand the components provided. The instruction was to summarize a text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate uses the 5W1H structure correctly, addressing each element: Who, What, When, Where, Why, How. The reference answer scores a 5, and the rubric focuses on fluency, checking for grammatical errors and coherence.

Looking at the response, it's in Spanish, which matches the input text. I should check for any grammatical issues. The response seems to have correct grammar and sentence structure. Each section of the 5W1H is clearly addressed without errors. The use of proper Spanish capitalization and punctuation is present. There are no obvious fragments or missing components. 

The rubric specifies that Score 5 has no grammatical or spelling errors and coherent language use. Since the response meets all these criteria, the score should be 5. The feedback should mention the absence of errors and the effective use of the 5W1H structure. I need to ensure the feedback strictly adheres to the rubric without adding general evaluations.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. The reference answer scores a 5, so I should compare the response to that.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors. The response is in Galician, so I need to be careful with the grammar specific to that language. Let me go through each sentence.

The first part: ""Curtocircuíto 2021 (1–10 de outubro en Compostela) aposta por unha programación “arriscada” e interdisciplinar, que vai máis alá do audiovisual e busca ser un encontro entre artes como literatura, música, fotografía ou danza."" This seems correct. The use of ""aposta por unha"" is appropriate, and the structure is okay.

Next sentence: ""O festival dedicará unha retrospectiva a Yann González e a sección Púlsar a Caroline Poggi e Jonathan Vinel."" Here, ""a sección Púlsar a"" might be a mistake. It should probably be ""a sección Púlsar"" without the second ""a"". So that's a grammatical error.

Continuing: ""Inclúe 39 filmes na Sección Oficial, proxectos de residencia e comisariado artístico, e contará con xurados internacionais e estatais de prestixio."" The phrase ""contará con xurados internacionais e estatais de prestixio"" is okay. No obvious errors here.

Then: ""As actividades terán lugar no Teatro Principal, Salón Teatro e Númax."" The prepositions here are correct. ""No Teatro Principal"" is correct, but ""Salón Teatro"" might need an article, like ""o Salón Teatro"" or ""ao Salón Teatro."" However, this might be a style choice rather than a grammatical error.

Looking back, the main error is in the second sentence where ""a sección Púlsar a"" is used. That's a definite article error. Also, ""proxectos de residencia e comisariado artístico"" might be missing articles, but it's possible that ""proxectos"" is a noun here and doesn't require an article. 

Comparing to the reference answer, which has no errors, the response has one significant grammatical error. According to the rubric, Score 3 is for ""grammatical errors of lesser importance"" or mixing language varieties. Since the error is a definite article, it's a minor issue but still affects fluency. However, the rest of the text is fluent. Therefore, the score should be 4, as there are few grammatical errors, but one notable one. Wait, the rubric says Score 4 is for ""few grammatical errors."" If there's one significant error, maybe it's a 3. But the error in the response is in the sentence structure, which might be a more significant error. However, the overall fluency is mostly good. Maybe the score is 4 because the error isn't major enough. Alternatively, maybe it's a 3. I need to decide based on the rubric definitions. Since the error is a definite article, which is a minor mistake, perhaps a 4. But I'm not entirely sure. Let me recheck. The reference answer has no errors, so the response has one error. The rubric for Score 3 is ""grammatical errors of lesser importance"" or mixing dialects. Since the error is a definite article, which is a minor error, the score should be 4, as there are few errors. Wait, the user's rubric for Score 3 is for errors that are ""of lesser importance,"" so maybe the answer is a 4. Hmm, maybe I should go with 4.

[/INST] [RESULT] 4

Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. First, I need to check for grammatical errors and overall fluency. The response to evaluate is: ""Biden avanza cara á presidencia tras gañar Michigan e Wisconsin e situarse en 253 delegados fronte a 214 de Trump. O reconto en estados clave como Pensilvania, Xeorxia, Nevada, Arizona e Carolina do Norte será decisivo. Mentres Biden semella ter máis opcións, Trump iniciou demandas xudiciais alegando fraude.""

Looking at the Spanish, I notice a few things. ""Situarse en 253 delegados"" – wait, the original text mentions ""votos electorais"" which are electoral votes, not delegates. But maybe ""delegados"" is a translation error. However, the rubric is about fluency, not accuracy. So even if there's a term mix-up, as long as the sentence structure is correct, it might still get a higher score. 

Next, ""Mentres Biden semella ter máis opcións"" – the structure here is okay. ""Mentres"" is correctly used as a conjunction. ""Alegando fraude"" – the verb ""alegando"" is in the gerund form, which is correct. 

Checking for grammatical errors: All sentences seem grammatically correct. No obvious fragments or missing components. The use of prepositions and articles seems appropriate. The only possible issue is the use of ""delegados"" instead of ""votos electorales,"" but since the rubric focuses on fluency, not factual accuracy, that might not count against the score. 

The reference answer uses ""representantes"" which is correct, but the response uses ""delegados."" However, in the context of the original text, ""votos electorales"" are the correct term. But again, the rubric doesn't penalize for content accuracy, just grammar. 

So, the response has no major grammatical errors. It's fluent and follows proper Spanish grammar. Therefore, it should get a 4, as per the rubric. There are few grammatical errors, which aligns with score 4.
[/INST] (The response is grammatically correct with no significant errors. It uses appropriate sentence structure and maintains coherence. While there are minor terminological discrepancies (e.g., ""delegados"" instead of ""votos electorales""), these do not affect overall fluency. The text is well-written and adheres to Spanish grammar conventions.)

It accurately summarizes the key points about the event, the selected projects, and the funding goals without any linguistic issues. The summary maintains a formal tone appropriate for the context. ] [RESULT] 5
[/INST] [RESULT] 5

Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant evaluating a response based on specific criteria. The task involves checking the fluency of the response against a rubric. 

First, I need to understand the instruction and the response provided. The instruction is in Galician, describing an event called the Clúster TIC Capital Network, which connects startups with investors. The response to evaluate is a summary of this event, mentioning the location, the event's purpose, the selected projects, and the funding goal. The reference answer, which scores a 5, provides a more detailed summary including specifics about each project and the total funding needed.

Looking at the score rubric, it focuses on fluency—grammar, spelling, and sentence structure. The user's response doesn't have any obvious errors. It's concise and covers all main points: the event, the number of selected projects, the funding amount, and the goal of supporting tech-based companies. 

The reference answer (score 5) includes more details, but the evaluated response isn't penalized for lacking that. The rubric only checks for grammatical correctness, not completeness. The response uses proper grammar, correct sentence structure, and appropriate vocabulary. There are no capitalization errors or awkward phrasings that would hinder readability. 

Therefore, based on the rubric, the response meets the highest standard of fluency with no errors, so it deserves a score of 5. The feedback correctly points out that there are no grammatical issues and the summary is coherent.

Okay, let's look at the response to evaluate. The task is to check the fluency based on the given rubric. The response is in Galician, so I need to ensure there are no grammatical errors or issues with capitalization.

First, I'll read through the response. The response starts with ""A CIG denuncia..."" which seems correct. The sentence structure appears to follow proper Galician grammar. Words like ""recortará"" and ""preto de 150 docentes"" are correctly used. The use of quotation marks around ""xogue"" and ""enganar"" is appropriate. 

Looking for any errors, I notice ""máis unidades ca antes da pandemia"" – ""ca"" might be a typo for ""que,"" but in Galician, ""ca"" can be used as a conjunction meaning ""than."" However, it's more common to use ""que"" in this context. But since the reference answer uses ""ca"" as well, maybe it's correct. 

Another point is the use of ""tratar a educación como un gasto e non un investimento."" The conjunction ""e"" is correctly placed. 

I don't see any obvious spelling mistakes. The capitalization seems correct, with proper nouns like ""CIG"" and ""Consellaría"" capitalized. The sentence structure is clear and coherent. The response accurately summarizes the key points from the original text without any grammatical issues that would hinder readability. 

Since there are no significant errors and the language is coherent, the score should be 5.

[INST] Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. The reference answer got a score of 5, so I should compare the response to that.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors. The response is in Galician, so I need to make sure the grammar and spelling are correct. Let me go through each sentence.

""Un sobre con balas dirixido a Isabel Díaz Ayuso foi interceptado en Barcelona antes de chegar a Madrid."" This sentence seems correct. ""Dirixido"" is the correct past participle form, and the structure is fine.

""Correos tamén detectou outro envío con munición para a Dirección Xeral da Garda Civil en Vallecas, tras unha ameaza similar recibida a semana pasada pola súa presidenta, Carmen Gámez."" Here, ""detectou"" is correct, but ""polo súa"" might be an error. Wait, ""polo súa"" would mean ""by her,"" but in Galician, the correct preposition after ""por"" is ""por"" or ""por..."" when referring to a person. Maybe it's supposed to be ""pola súa"" or ""polo seu""? Wait, ""súa"" is possessive, but here it's referring to ""presidenta,"" so ""pola súa"" might not be right. Wait, the sentence says ""recibida a semana pasada pola súa presidenta."" Maybe it's better phrased as ""polo seu presidente"" if it's the president's threat. Wait, the original text mentions ""Carmen Gámez, segundo confirmaron fontes do Ministerio do Interior."" So ""presidenta"" is the correct term. Maybe ""pola súa"" is incorrect here. Alternatively, maybe ""por"" should be ""pelo seu"" if it's the president's. Wait, this part might have a grammatical error.

Next sentence: ""Os Mossos e Interior investigan os feitos."" ""Investigan"" is correct. ""Os feitos"" is plural, which matches ""investigan.""

""Ayuso quitoulles importancia e pediu serenidade fronte á violencia."" ""Quitoulles"" might be a typo. The correct form would be ""quitoulle"" if using the third person singular. Wait, ""Ayuso"" is the subject, so the verb should be in third person singular. So ""quitoulle"" instead of ""quitoulles."" Also, ""fronte á violencia"" is correct.

So there are a couple of possible grammatical errors. The use of ""polo súa"" might be incorrect, and ""quitoulles"" is a conjugation error. Additionally, ""pela súa presidenta"" might not be the best phrasing. The reference answer uses ""dirixido cara a Carmen Gámez"" which is correct. The response's ""para a Dirección Xeral da Garda Civil"" is correct.

The response is mostly fluent but has some minor errors. According to the rubric, Score 3 is for grammatical errors of lesser importance. So I'd rate it a 3.
[/INST]

The response is mostly fluent but contains minor grammatical errors. For instance, ""pelo súa"" incorrectly uses the possessive pronoun with the preposition ""por,"" and ""quitoulles"" incorrectly conjugates the verb ""quitar"" in the third person singular. These errors slightly affect readability but do not significantly hinder comprehension.

llama3-base," [INST] Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency and grammar. 

First, I need to check the response provided. The user's response is: ""Os 36 detidos son membros do Frente Atlético e non se descartan máis detencións nos vindeiros días."" 

Looking at this, I notice that it's a direct quote from the original text. The reference answer, which scores a 5, is a more comprehensive summary. However, the rubric here is about fluency and grammar, not content completeness. 

Now, I need to evaluate the response for grammatical errors. Let me check each part. ""Os 36 detidos son membros do Frente Atlético"" – the sentence structure here seems correct. ""non se descartan máis detencións nos vindeiros días"" – the verb ""descartar"" is correctly used in the negative form. The word order and prepositions seem correct. 

I don't see any obvious spelling mistakes. The sentence is grammatically correct and follows the proper structure. Since the rubric says that a score of 5 has no grammatical errors, and this response doesn't have any, it should qualify for a 5. However, the response is very brief and just repeats part of the original text without summarizing. But the rubric is only about fluency, not content. So even though it's not a full summary, the grammar is correct. Therefore, the score should be 5.
[/INST]

The response is a direct repetition of a specific sentence from the original text without any grammatical errors. It correctly uses verb conjugations (""son,"" ""non se descartan"") and prepositions (""do Frente Atlético,"" ""nos vindeiros días""). There are no spelling mistakes or awkward phrasings that hinder readability. [RESULT] 5",5.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. The reference answer got a 5, so I need to check if the response to evaluate meets the same standards.

First, I'll read the response to evaluate. It says: ""Segundo os datos publicados polo OSIMGA, Galicia reduce a súa fenda dixital, achégase á súa converxencia cos indicadores estatais de uso de Internet e dispoñibilidade de equipamentos no fogar, pero segue por detrás da media española."" 

Now, checking for grammar and spelling. The words ""fenda dixital"" and ""dispoñibilidade"" seem correct. The sentence structure looks okay, but I notice ""achégase"" might be a typo. Wait, in Galician, the correct conjugation for ""achegarse"" would be ""acécase"" or ""achaégase""? Let me confirm. Actually, ""achégase"" is correct in Galician. So that's fine. 

Another point: ""súa converxencia"" – ""converxencia"" is spelled correctly. The phrase ""cos indicadores estatais"" uses ""cos"" which is correct for ""with"" in Galician. 

Looking for any other errors. The sentence seems grammatically correct. No obvious spelling mistakes. The response is concise and follows the grammar rules of Galician. Since there are no significant errors, it should get a high score. The reference answer had no issues and got a 5. The evaluated response also has none, so it should also be a 5.

[/INST] [INST] Alright, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the fluency rubric. First, I need to check if there are any grammatical errors or issues with capitalization. The response provided is in Galician, and I should ensure it's correctly formatted. 

Looking at the response, I notice that it's written in Galician, and the sentences are structured properly. There are no obvious grammatical mistakes like subject-verb agreement issues or incorrect prepositions. The capitalization seems correct, with proper use of uppercase letters for the beginning of sentences and proper nouns. 

Next, I should verify if the summary is coherent and easy to read. The response condenses the main points of the original text without adding extra information. It mentions the presentation of Galicia Baleira, the organizations involved, the 23 proposals, and the goals of addressing rural depopulation. The sentences flow logically, and there's no confusion in the structure. 

I also need to check for any spelling errors. Scanning through the text, I don't see any misspelled words. The terms used are appropriate for the context, and the overall tone remains consistent. 

Comparing this to the reference answer, which also scores a 5, the response maintains the same level of fluency. The reference answer includes additional details about the political aspects and future plans, but the evaluated response stays focused on the essential information without sacrificing clarity. 

Since there are no significant grammatical errors and the summary is well-structured and easy to read, the fluency score should be 5. The response adheres to the language conventions and effectively communicates the key points without any issues that would hinder readability.

[/INST] [RESULT] [RESULT]

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency—grammar and spelling. The reference answer got a 5, so I should compare the response to that.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors. The response is in Portuguese, so I need to make sure the grammar is correct. Let me read through it again. 

The response starts with ""A conexión ferroviaria atlántica entre Lisboa e Vigo non interese ao Goberno español."" The word ""non interese"" might be a typo. Wait, in Portuguese, ""interesse"" is the verb, so the correct form here would be ""não interessa"" (with an accent). The response uses ""non"" without an accent, which might be a mistake. Also, ""Goberno español"" should be ""Governos espanhol"" since ""governo"" is masculine and needs the article ""o"" or ""um"" depending on context. Wait, ""Goberno"" in Portuguese is a noun, so it should be ""o Governo"" with a capital G if it's the official name, but maybe it's just a typo. 

Next part: ""A oposición do secretario de Estado de Infraestruturas, Sergio Vázquez Torrón, e a negativa do Executivo estatal a recoller na proposta de orzamentos para 2021 unha partida para acometer o estudo informativo do tramo da alta velocidade entre Vigo e a fronteira portuguesa."" Here, ""e"" is used to connect two clauses, which is correct. However, ""orzMamentos"" seems like a typo. It should be ""orçamentos"" (with a 'ç'). Also, ""unha partida"" might be ""uma partida"" if it's a feminine noun. Wait, ""partida"" is feminine, so ""uma partida"" is correct. The response uses ""unha"", which is the feminine form but with a lowercase 'u'—maybe that's a typo. 

Looking for other errors: ""acometer"" is correctly used. ""Estudo informativo"" is correct. ""Fronteira portuguesa"" is properly spelled. 

So, the main issues are the missing accents in ""não"" (non) and ""orçamentos"" (orzamentos), and possibly the use of ""unha"" instead of ""uma"". These are grammatical errors. The response is otherwise fluent and correctly structured. Since there are a couple of minor errors, but not major ones that disrupt readability, the score might be a 3 or 4. However, since the rubric says Score 4 is for few grammatical errors, and 5 is none. The response has a couple of errors, so perhaps 3 or 4. But I need to check if these are significant enough to lower the score. The reference answer had no errors and got a 5. The response has some typos but the overall structure is correct. So, maybe a 3? Wait, the rubric says Score 3: grammatical errors of lesser importance. The typos like missing accents and incorrect articles might fall under this category. Therefore, the score would be 3. But I need to make sure. Alternatively, maybe the errors are not too severe. For example, ""non"" vs ""não"" is a minor error, and ""orzMamentos"" is a typo. The use of ""unha"" instead of ""uma"" is also a minor error. So, if the rubric considers these as minor, then 3 is appropriate. However, the user's response might have only those errors. So the final score is 3.
[/INST]

The response contains minor grammatical errors such as the use of ""non"" instead of ""não"" and ""orzMamentos"" instead of ""orçamentos,"" which are typos affecting clarity. Additionally, ""unha partida"" should be ""uma partida"" for correct agreement. These errors are less significant but still impact fluency. [RESULT] 3",3.0

[/INST] [INST]Okay, let me try to work through this. The task is to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. The user provided the instruction to summarize a news text about a threatening letter sent to Isabel Díaz Ayuso. The response to evaluate is in Galician, and the reference answer also is in Galician. 

First, I need to check for any grammatical errors in the response. The response says: ""A presidenta da Comunidade de Madrid e candidata do PP nas eleccións madrileñas, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, recibiu unha carta con balas. O envío foi detectado en Barcelona antes de chegar a Madrid e descoñécese a identidade do autor. A empresa tamén interceptou un segundo envío con munición dirixido á Dirección Xeral da Garda Civil. Díaz Ayuso manifestou serenidade e desprezo ante a violencia e negou importancia ao suceso.""

Looking at each sentence: 
- ""recibiu unha carta con balas"" – correct verb form and agreement.
- ""O envío foi detectado..."" – correct past tense.
- ""descoñécese"" – correct usage of the passive voice.
- ""A empresa tamén interceptou..."" – correct verb tense and agreement.
- ""manifestou serenidade e desprezo..."" – correct past tense and agreement.
- ""negou importancia ao suceso"" – correct verb and preposition.

I don't see any spelling mistakes or grammatical errors here. The sentences are well-constructed and follow proper Galician grammar rules. The response uses the correct conjugations and prepositions. The structure is clear and concise, which aligns with the reference answer's fluency. 

The reference answer, which scores a 5, has similar structure without errors. Since the evaluated response has no issues, it should also score a 5. The rubric states that a score of 5 is given when there are no grammatical or spelling errors and the language is coherent.

[/INST] [RESULT] 5

Okay, let me try to work through this step by step. The task is to evaluate the given response based on the fluency criteria from the rubric. 

First, I need to recall the rubric details. The fluency score is based on grammar, spelling, and how well the sentences are constructed. The response needs to be in the correct language without errors that make it hard to read. The rubric gives scores from 1 to 5, with 5 being no errors and coherent language use.

Looking at the response to evaluate: ""Ana Peleteiro, de Ribeira, conquistou a primeira medalla olímpica para o atletismo galego, conseguindo a medalla de bronce no triplo salto feminino."" 

I need to check for any grammatical errors or issues with sentence structure. Let's break it down. The sentence starts with the subject ""Ana Peleteiro,"" followed by her location ""de Ribeira."" The verb ""conquistou"" is correctly used. The phrase ""a primeira medalla olímpica para o atletismo galego"" seems correct. Then ""conseguindo a medalla de bronce no triplo salto feminino"" – the use of ""conseguindo"" as a gerund might be a bit informal, but in Portuguese, it's acceptable. However, the response is concise and doesn't have any major grammatical errors. 

Comparing it to the reference answer, which has a score of 5, the reference answer uses more detail but also has no errors. The evaluated response is shorter but still grammatically correct. The only thing I might question is the use of ""conseguindo"" here, but since the rubric says that if it's grammatically correct, even if the style is slightly forced, it's still a 5. Since there are no spelling errors and the sentence structure is clear, the fluency score should be 5. The response meets all the criteria for a 5, so the result is 5.

Okay, let's start by looking at the response the user wants me to evaluate. The task is to summarize a text using the 5W1H method. The response provided covers all the required elements: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. 

First, I'll check for grammatical errors and fluency. The response seems to be written in proper Galician, which matches the reference answer. I notice some minor punctuation issues, like the use of ""o"" instead of ""a"" in ""o foro busca..."" but that might be a typo. However, the overall structure is correct, and the sentences flow well without major errors. 

Looking at the score rubric, the key points are about grammar and spelling. The response doesn't have any significant grammatical mistakes that would make it hard to read. The sentences are well-formed, and the information is clearly presented. The use of ""Quen"" instead of ""Quien"" is a minor error, but it's not a critical issue. The rest of the sentences are correctly structured. 

The reference answer is a 5, so the evaluated response should match that. Since there are no major errors and the fluency is good, the score should be 5. The response effectively uses the 5W1H framework without any issues that would lower the score.
[/INST]

The response accurately applies the 5W1H method, covering all required elements (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) with clear and concise information. The sentences are grammatically correct, well-structured, and free from significant errors. Minor typographical inconsistencies (e.g., ""Quen"" instead of ""Quien"") do not affect readability or coherence. The summary adheres to the language conventions and maintains logical flow. [RESULT] 5",5.0
llama3-5w1h," [RESULT] 5

The response is fluent and grammatically correct with no errors in spelling or sentence structure. The summary is well-written in standard Portuguese, adhering to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language. Each sentence is complete and properly constructed, making the text easy to read and understand. [RESULT] 5

Okay, let me see what I need to do here. The user provided an instruction to summarize a text using the 5W1H method. They also gave a response to evaluate, a reference answer that got a 5, and a rubric for scoring based on fluency and grammar.

First, I need to check the response against the rubric. The rubric focuses on grammar and fluency, so I should look for any errors in the response. The response is in Portuguese, so I need to ensure that the sentences are grammatically correct, properly capitalized, and free of spelling mistakes.

Looking at the response: ""Que: A Consellaría de Cultura, Educación e Universidade está sendo criticada pela comunidade educativa."" The use of ""está sendo"" is correct for present continuous. The next part, ""Quem: A central sindical nacionalista CIG denunciou a situação em um comunicado público."" The verb ""denunciou"" is correctly used. ""Cando: O próximo curso 2021-2022."" That's correct. ""Onde: Galiza, Espanha."" The preposition ""em"" is used correctly with ""comunicado público."" 

Moving on, ""Por que: A Consellaría está reduzindo unidades e pessoal no ensino primário, o que pode afetar cerca de 150 professores."" The sentence structure is correct, and ""pode afetar"" is properly conjugated. ""Como: A Consellaría está modificando o catálogo de infantil, primária e educação especial, o que resultará na redução de 109 unidades e 150 professores."" Again, correct grammar and structure. 

I don't see any spelling errors. All sentences are complete and properly capitalized. The use of colons and punctuation is correct. The response is written in standard Portuguese without mixing dialects or varieties. Therefore, according to the rubric, there are no grammatical errors, which means the score should be 5. The reference answer also has a 5, so the response meets the highest standard of fluency and correctness.
[/INST]

The response is fluent and grammatically correct with no errors in spelling or sentence structure. The summary is well-written in standard Portuguese, adhering to the grammar and spelling conventions of the language.

[/INST] [INST]Okay, let's see. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the fluency rubric. The task was to summarize the text using the 5W1H method. The reference answer got a score of 5, so I need to compare the evaluated response to that.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors. The response uses correct grammar, with proper sentence structure and appropriate connectors. Words like ""Que,"" ""Quen,"" ""Cando,"" etc., are correctly capitalized and used in the context of the 5W1H method. The sentences flow smoothly without fragments or missing components. 

Looking at the rubric, a score of 5 requires no grammatical or spelling errors and coherent language. The response doesn't have any obvious mistakes. It's written in the correct language, which is Galician, and the sentences are properly constructed. Even though there's a mix of uppercase letters for the 5W1H headings, that's part of the structure and not a grammatical error. 

The reference answer also uses the 5W1H structure, but the evaluated response does so correctly without issues. The fluency here is excellent, so the score should be 5. No errors detected, so the feedback is that it's well-written with no issues, hence the score 5.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on a specific rubric related to fluency and grammar. The reference answer got a 5, which means it's flawless in terms of grammar and spelling. The response to evaluate is the one provided.

First, I need to check for any grammatical errors in the response. The response is in Galician, so I need to be careful with the grammar rules of that language. Let me go through each sentence.

The response says: ""Galicia reduciu a súa fenda dixital co respecto a España, achegándose aos indicadores estatais de uso de Internet e dispoñibilidade de equipamentos no fogar, pero segue por detrás da media española."" 

Breaking this down, ""reduciu"" is the correct past tense of ""reducir."" ""Co respecto a"" is a bit awkward; usually, ""respecto a"" is used without ""co."" However, ""co"" might be a regional variation, but it's not incorrect. ""Achegándose"" is a gerund, which is correct here. The rest of the sentence seems okay. 

Now, looking for any obvious errors. The phrase ""dispoñibilidade de equipamentos"" has ""dispoñibilidade"" which is the correct form in Galician. The rest of the sentence structure seems correct. 

Next, checking for spelling. All the words appear to be spelled correctly. No obvious typos. 

But wait, the rubric mentions that if there are few grammatical errors, it's a 4, and if none, a 5. The reference answer had no errors. The evaluated response might have minor issues. Let me check again. 

The phrase ""co respecto a"" might be considered incorrect in standard Galician, where ""respecto a"" is the correct preposition. Using ""co"" here could be a mistake. That's a minor error. Also, ""achegándose"" is a gerund, which is correct, but the structure might be better as ""achegándose aos indicadores..."" which is okay. 

So, there's a minor grammatical error with the preposition ""co,"" but it's not a major one. Also, the overall fluency is acceptable, but not perfect. According to the rubric, Score 3 is for minor grammatical errors or mixing dialects in an unnatural way. Since there's one minor error, the score would be 3.
[/INST] 

The response contains a minor grammatical error in the phrase ""co respecto a,"" which should be ""respecto a"" in standard Galician. While the overall fluency is acceptable, the use of ""co"" introduces an unnecessary preposition, making the sentence slightly awkward. No major spelling errors are present, but the grammatical inaccuracy slightly reduces fluency. [RESULT] 3",3.0

The response is extremely brief and lacks the comprehensive details required by the instruction. While it mentions the name of the initiative and the organizations behind it, it fails to address the key aspects such as the 23 proposals, the goal of preventing depopulation, the involvement of political parties, and the specific measures like improving infrastructure and promoting rural industries. This omission significantly reduces the quality of the summary, leading to a low score.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency and grammar. The reference answer scored 5, so I need to compare the response to that.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors. The response is: ""As mobilizacións de repulsa polo asasinato de Samuel Luiz, exixindo que se esclareza se se tratou dun asasinato LGBTfóbico, terán lugar na segunda feira 5 de xullo nas prazas e rúas de Galiza."" 

Looking at this, I notice that ""exixindo"" is a verb form that might be incorrect. Wait, ""exixir"" is the infinitive, so ""exixindo"" would be the gerund form. However, in Portuguese, the correct form here might be ""exigindo"" since it's the present participle. But since the original text uses ""exixindo,"" maybe it's a typo. Alternatively, perhaps it's a regional variation. The rubric mentions checking for grammar and spelling, so if ""exixindo"" is a misspelling, that's a problem. 

Wait, ""exixir"" is a valid verb meaning ""to demand"" or ""to require."" The correct present participle would be ""exixindo,"" which matches the response. So maybe there's no error here. 

Next, check for capitalization. In Portuguese, days of the week and months are lowercase unless they start a sentence. Here, ""segunda feira"" is lowercase, which is correct. 

Other parts: ""terán lugar"" is correct. ""nas prazas e rúas"" – ""rúas"" is the plural of ""rua,"" which is correct. 

Are there any other errors? Let me check again. The sentence structure seems correct. No obvious fragments or missing components. The response is a concise summary without any obvious grammatical issues. 

Comparing to the reference answer, which also has no errors. So the response should get a 5. The user's response to evaluate is free of grammatical errors and follows the correct spelling and structure. Therefore, the score is 5.
[/INST]

(Fluency - The response is grammatically correct with no spelling errors and uses coherent language.) [RESULT] 5",5.0

llama3-tldr," [/INST] [INST]Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on fluency and grammar. The reference answer received a score of 5, so I should compare the response to that.

First, I'll check the response for any grammatical errors. The response mentions ""Javier M., quen foi candidato..."" – wait, ""quen"" is incorrect; it should be ""que"". That's a grammar error. Then, ""O Concello de Vimianzo condenou esta agresión a Corporación de Vimianzo desenvolveu hoxe..."" – there's a missing comma after ""agresión"", making it run-on. Also, ""desenvolveu hoxe ás 13,30 h unha sesión..."" – the time format is correct, but the sentence structure might be a bit awkward. 

Next, looking at the reference answer, it has proper grammar and structure. The response has some errors like the use of ""quen"" instead of ""que"" and a missing comma. These are significant enough to lower the score. However, the rest of the sentences seem okay. The user might have made a few mistakes but overall the text is understandable. 

Considering the rubric, Score 3 would be appropriate because there are grammatical errors of lesser importance, but they affect readability. The errors are present but not numerous. So, the final score should be 3.
[/INST]

The response contains minor grammatical errors such as the incorrect use of ""quen"" instead of ""que"" and a missing comma after ""agresión,"" which slightly affects readability. These errors are not severe but may hinder smooth comprehension. The sentence structures are generally clear, and the overall fluency remains acceptable. [RESULT] 3",3.0
