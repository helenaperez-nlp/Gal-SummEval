Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on maintaining all important information (5W1H) from the source text. The rubric ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the highest score. 

First, I'll look at the reference answer that received a score of 5. It includes details like who (the victims and involved groups), what (the assault and subsequent arrests), when (two weeks after the murder), where (Madrid and Xixón), why (security failures and political pressure), and how (the operation Neptuno and methods used). It also mentions the outcome, such as the number of arrests and the ongoing investigation.

Now, the response to evaluate is the user's summary. Let me check what they included. They mention that two months after the murder of Jimmy, nearly a hundred people are involved, including two suspected material authors. They note most belong to Frente Atlético and some have military or police backgrounds. They mention ongoing investigations and possible future arrests. However, the response doesn't specify the exact date (30 November), the groups involved (Riazor Blues, Ultra Boys), the location of the incident (Madrid and Xixón), the specific charges (illegal possession of weapons, rioting), the political controversy over security errors, the pressure to ban ultras, and the criticism of the stadium seating arrangement. 

Wait, the user's response says ""two months"" but the original text mentions ""dúas semanas despois"" (two weeks). That's a discrepancy. Also, the reference answer correctly states ""dúas semanas"" and the exact date. The user's summary missed the exact date and the time frame. Additionally, the user didn't mention the groups involved (Riazor Blues, Ultra Boys), the specific charges, the political controversy, or the stadium seating issue. They also omitted the part about the police investigation using camera footage and mobile phones. 

So, according to the rubric, if the summary lacks several relevant Ws, it would be a lower score. The user's summary misses several key points: the exact date, the groups involved, the charges, the political context, the stadium seating, and the investigative methods. Therefore, it's missing multiple Ws, leading to a score lower than 5. The reference answer covers all these aspects, so scoring a 5. The user's response is missing several important elements, so the score should be 3, as it lacks several relevant Ws.
[/INST]
The response fails to maintain key elements from the source text, specifically missing critical details like the exact date of the incident (30 November), the involvement of specific groups (Riazor Blues, Ultra Boys), the precise charges (illegal weapon possession, rioting), and the political controversy over security failures. It also omits the operational details (e.g., Operation Neptuno's methods) and the impact on stadium policies. These omissions indicate a significant lack of essential Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how) from the source. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric is about maintaining all important information (5W1H) from the source document. The reference answer gets a score of 5, so I need to see how the evaluated response compares.

First, I'll read through the instruction text to understand the key points. The main topics are the lack of Spanish government interest in the Lisbon-Vigo rail link, opposition from officials like Sergio Vázquez Torrón, the refusal to include budget items for studies, the blame shifting between governments, the Portuguese government's stance, the focus on the Atlantic axis, the Eurocity Cerveira-Tomiño event, the commitment to improve Porto-Vigo connections, and funding from European recovery funds.

Next, I'll examine the response to evaluate. It mentions the lack of interest from the Spanish government, the absence of budget allocations, and the Portuguese government's pressure. However, it cuts off mid-sentence. The summary also talks about the 876 million euros for the Atlantic axis but notes that specific infrastructure funds aren't included. It mentions studies without dates or timelines.

Now, checking against the 5W1H criteria. The reference answer covers who (governments, ministers), what (rail projects, funding), when (cumio in October), where (Spain, Portugal, Galicia), why (economic ties, cost), how (European funds, plans). The evaluated response seems to miss some elements. For instance, it doesn't mention the specific minister (Ana Abrunhosa) or the exact funding sources (European recovery funds). It also lacks details on the timeline of projects or the specific plans like the 2030 investment plan. The cutoff mid-sentence might mean important info about the Portuguese government's focus on the Atlantic axis and the reduction in travel time isn't fully covered. 

So, the evaluated response misses several key elements from the source, which would lower the score. According to the rubric, if it's missing several important Ws, that's a score of 3. But maybe there's more. Wait, the rubric says score 3 is when several relevant Ws are missing. Since the response includes some elements but omits others, maybe a 3 or 4. But since the response is cut off and doesn't cover all aspects, I think it's more like missing several, so a 3.

Okay, let's tackle this step by step. The task is to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on maintaining all important information from the source text using the 5W1H framework (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). The reference answer scores a 5, so I need to compare the evaluated response against that standard.

First, I'll break down the source text to identify all the key elements. The main points are:

- **Who**: Samuel Luiz, the victim, an 24-year-old nurse from Meicende, Arzúa. Also mentions Avante LGTBI+ as the organizer.
- **What**: A murder of Samuel Luiz, suspected to be homophobic. The response includes calls for justice and protests.
- **When**: The murder occurred on July 3rd, midnight. The protests are on July 5th.
- **Where**: Various locations in Galicia, including Coruña, Santiago de Compostela, Vigo, Ferrol, etc. Specific places like the Hotel Riazor in Coruña.
- **Why**: To denounce the murder, seek justice, and address possible homophobic motives.
- **How**: Protests with banners, white shirts, readings against hate crimes and machismo violence.

Now, looking at the evaluated response:

- It mentions the number of protests (50+), but doesn't specify the exact number mentioned in the source (which lists 50 confirmed).
- It talks about the cause (denouncing the murder, seeking justice) but misses some details like the victim's background (nurse, from Meicende, 24 years old).
- It references the location (cities like Coruña, Santiago, Vigo) but omits specific locations like the Hotel Riazor in Coruña and the exact locations in each city (e.g., Plaza de María Pita in Coruña).
- It mentions the police investigation under secrecy but doesn't include the part about the judge's order.
- It notes the protests are organized by Avante LGTBI+ but doesn't explicitly state that the organization is the one calling for the protests, though that's implied.

The response also includes some extra info not in the source, like the clothing (white shirts) and specific activities (readings of manifests), which might be acceptable but aren't critical for the 5W1H. However, the main issue is missing key details like the victim's identity, the suspect's motive, and specific locations. 

Since the rubric is about maintaining all important information, the evaluated response is missing several key elements (like the victim's details, specific locations, the motive of homophobia, and the legal aspects like the secret trial). Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for a 5, but it does cover more than just a few Ws, so it's not a 1 or 2. It's missing several, so a 3 seems appropriate.

It also omits the organization (Avante LGTBI+) and the broader list of cities involved. While it covers parts of the ""what"" and ""why,"" it misses several essential elements from the source text.

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate has some elements but needs to be checked against the rubric.

First, I'll check the rubric: Score 5 requires all 5W1H elements from the source. The reference answer clearly includes all the Ws. Now, looking at the response provided:

The user's response mentions ""Quen? Yann González."" That covers 'Who'. ""Cando? Do 1 ao 10 de outubro."" That's 'When'. ""Onde? Santiago de Compostela."" 'Where'. ""Por que? Para revisar as artes desde o teórico ata o visceral."" 'Why'. ""Como? cunha programación arriscada..."" 'How'. Then there's ""Que? Un novo filme."" Wait, the original text doesn't mention a new film specifically. The main event is the festival, not a new movie. Also, the response includes extra details like ""Cal? Curtocircuíto 2021."" which is the event name, not a W. Then there are entries like ""En que sección? Na sección Púlsar."" which might be part of 'Where' or 'What', but the rubric is about the Ws. 

However, the main issue is that the response doesn't fully cover all the Ws. For example, 'What' is partially addressed with ""Un novo filme,"" but the original text refers to the festival's program, not a specific new film. The reference answer covers 'What' by mentioning the festival's purpose and activities. The user's response also includes some extra information not in the 5W1H structure, like ""Cal?"" and ""Con que?"" which are not part of the required categories. 

Additionally, the response misses some key elements from the source. For instance, the reference answer mentions the expansion to include long films and interdisciplinary projects, which the user's response doesn't fully capture. The user's answer also includes ""Onde? Santiago de Compostela,"" which is correct for 'Where', but maybe the original text had more specific locations beyond just the city. 

Overall, the response includes most of the required Ws but adds some irrelevant details and misses some key points. According to the rubric, if the summary lacks several relevant Ws, that would be a lower score. Since the user's answer includes Who, When, Where, Why, How, but not fully What, and adds extra info, it's missing at least one key W. So, the score would be 4 because it's missing one relevant W.
[/INST]

(Feedback for criteria) The response correctly identifies most of the 5W1H elements but fails to fully address the 'What' component. It mentions ""Un novo filme"" which is not explicitly stated in the source text, and omits critical details about the festival's expanded scope (long films, interdisciplinary projects). Additionally, it includes extraneous elements like ""Cal?"" and ""Con que?"" which are not part of the 5W1H framework. While 'Who', 'When', 'Where', 'Why', and 'How' are addressed, the summary lacks depth in capturing the full scope of the event as per the source. [RESULT] 4",4.0

Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the 5W1H rubric. The user provided the instruction to summarize the text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate is the one given, and the reference answer scores a 5.

First, I'll look at the response. The user's response mentions ""Quen"" (Who) with Sergio Vázquez Torrón and Ana Abrunhosa. Then ""Cando"" (When) as ""actualmente"" (currently). ""Onde"" (Where) is Galicia and Norte de Portugal. ""Por que"" (Why) refers to the Spanish government's lack of interest. However, the response doesn't mention ""What,"" ""When,"" ""How,"" and possibly other elements. Wait, the response includes ""Cando"" (When) as ""actualmente,"" but the original text talks about specific times like the 2021 budget proposal and the 2023-2026 timeline. The response might have missed those details. Also, ""What"" is missing entirely. The response only mentions the ""what"" in the ""Por que"" section, but not explicitly. The ""how"" is also missing. The reference answer includes all elements, so the evaluated response likely lacks several Ws. According to the rubric, a score of 3 would mean the summary lacks several relevant Ws. So the score should be 3.
[/INST]

The response partially addresses the ""who,"" ""when,"" and ""where"" elements but completely omits ""what,"" ""why,"" and ""how."" It mentions the individuals involved (Sergio Vázquez Torrón and Ana Abrunhosa) and the location (Galicia and Norte de Portugal), but fails to describe the main issue (the Atlantic railway connection between Lisbon and Vigo), the timeline (including 2021 budget rejection, 2023-2026 project phases), or the reasoning behind the political stances. The ""why"" section is incomplete and unclear, while the ""how"" is entirely absent.

salamandra-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the 5W1H criteria. The reference answer got a score of 5, so I need to compare the given response to that.

First, the instruction was to summarize the text using the 5W1H method. The response provided by the user has sections labeled with ""Quen"", ""Cando"", ""Onde"", ""Por que"", ""Como"", ""Que"". Wait, but the 5W1H includes What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. So the response here has ""Quen"" (Who), ""Cando"" (When), ""Onde"" (Where), ""Por que"" (Why), ""Como"" (How), and ""Que"" (What). That seems to cover all the required elements. 

But I need to check if each of these is correctly addressed. Let's break down the original text. The main points are: the uncertainty about the new president after the elections, Biden gaining votes in key states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the current count (253 vs 214), Trump's legal challenges in states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, etc., and the potential for Biden to reach 270 electoral votes.

Looking at the response: ""Quen"" lists both candidates, which covers ""Who"". ""Cando"" says ""este martes"" (this Tuesday), which is the time, so ""When"". ""Onde"" is ""Estados Unidos"", covering ""Where"". ""Por que"" states that the new president isn't known yet, addressing ""Why"". ""Como"" mentions the slow and doubtful count, which relates to ""How"". ""Que"" refers to the day after the elections, which is part of ""What"". The last sentence mentions their competition for the presidency, which ties into ""What"".

However, the reference answer includes all the Ws. The user's response seems to cover all the required elements. Wait, but in the response, the ""Que"" is ""un día despois das eleccións"" which is part of ""What"". Also, the ""Por que"" is about the uncertainty, which is the reason. The ""Como"" covers the process of recounting. So all the Ws are present. 

Wait, but the user's response might not have explicitly stated all the elements. For example, the ""What"" in the original text is about the election results and uncertainty. The response does mention that the new president isn't known yet, which is part of ""What"". The ""How"" is about the recount process being slow and doubtful. The ""When"" is the day after the elections. ""Where"" is the US. ""Who"" are the candidates. ""Why"" is the uncertainty. So all elements are covered. 

Therefore, the response meets all the criteria for a score of 5. But wait, the reference answer also includes more details about the states and the current counts. However, the rubric is about maintaining all important information from the source. Since the user's response includes all the necessary Ws, even if some details are missing, the rubric focuses on the presence of the Ws, not the depth of information. So even if the response is brief, as long as each W is present, it should be a 5. Therefore, the score should be 5.

The response includes all the required 5W1H elements (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) from the source text. It clearly identifies the candidates (Who), the uncertainty about the outcome (What), the timing (When), the location (Where), the reason for uncertainty (Why), and the process of recounting (How). Each element is explicitly addressed without omitting any critical information. [RESULT] 5",5.0

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the 5W1H rubric. First, I need to understand what the 5W1H method entails—what, who, when, where, why, and how. The reference answer scored 5, so I should compare the response to that.

Looking at the response to evaluate, it lists characters but doesn't summarize the event using the 5W1H framework. The reference answer includes all the necessary elements: what happened (aggression), who (Javier M., Montse L.), when (15 May), where (Vimianzo), why (machismo), and how (stabbings, police involvement). 

The evaluated response only provides character roles without addressing the key elements of the event. It doesn't mention the incident itself, the time, location, reasons, or methods. Therefore, it fails to cover any of the Ws in 5W1H. According to the rubric, a score of 1 means no relevant Ws, which fits here. The response doesn't even attempt to summarize the event, just lists characters. So the score should be 1.

It addresses ""who"" (Mossos d'Esquadra, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, forces of security), ""what"" (letter with bullets, investigation), ""when"" (last hours of Wednesday), ""where"" (Barcelona, Madrid, Vallecas), and ""why"" (to prevent arrival in Madrid, directed to the director general of the Civil Guard). However, it lacks the ""how"" element, which refers to the method used to detect the bullets (via Correos controls) and the second package sent to Carmen Gámez. Additionally, it repeats some points without clearly distinguishing them. [RESULT] 4",4.0

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the 5W1H rubric, which checks if all important information from the source is maintained. 

First, I'll look at the original instruction and the reference answer. The reference answer scores a 5 because it includes all the key points: the reduction in the digital divide, the comparison to Spain's average, factors like urban vs. rural and age groups, specific percentages, growth rates, and mentions of online shopping. It also includes the source (OSIMGA) and the date (2012).

Now, looking at the response to evaluate. The user's response mentions that Galicia reduced the digital gap but is still below the national average. It covers urban vs. rural areas and age groups, specifically noting younger people (16-44) using more internet and older folks (over 45) using less. It also includes the 16.4% of the population doing online shopping with a 13.9% increase. However, it doesn't mention the specific percentages for internet access (like 58.3% vs. 63.9%), the growth rate comparison (Galicia's 9.4% vs. Spain's 4.8%), or the narrowing of the gap by 4.6 points. Also, the source (OSIMGA) and the date (March 12, 2012) are included, which is good. 

Wait, the reference answer includes the source and date, so the response here does include those. But the key points missing are the specific statistics like the 58.3% vs. 63.9%, the growth rates, the 4.6 point reduction in the gap, and the broadband usage details. The response also doesn't mention the 67.9% in big cities vs. 43.3% in rural areas. These are critical data points from the original text that the response omits. 

So, according to the rubric, a score of 5 requires all relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how). The response misses several important details like the exact percentages, growth rates, and the narrowing of the gap. Therefore, it doesn't cover all the necessary information, leading to a lower score. The reference answer includes all these details, while the evaluated response lacks them. Hence, the score would be lower than 5, perhaps a 3 or 4. But since the rubric's 4 is when one W is missing, and 3 is when several are missing, the response is missing multiple Ws. Therefore, the correct score is 3.
[/INST]

(Feedback for criteria) The response captures some key elements like the reduction in the digital divide, urban-rural disparities, age group differences, and online shopping growth. However, it omits crucial specific data points such as exact percentages (e.g., 58.3% vs. 63.9% internet access, 4.6-point gap reduction), growth rate comparisons (Galicia's 9.4% vs. Spain's 4.8%), broadband statistics (67.9% in cities vs. 43.3% in rural areas), and the 2010-2011 data. While it includes the source and date, significant numerical and comparative details are missing. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on maintaining all the important information from the source using the 5W1H criteria. The reference answer scores a 5, so I need to compare the response to that.

First, the original instruction provides a detailed news article about the murder of Samuel Luiz in Galicia. The key points include the date of the event (July 3rd), the location (near Hotel Riazor in A Coruña), the victim's details (24 years old, nurse from Meicende), the cause of death (multiple blows from a mallet), the ongoing investigation by the National Police, the 50+ protests on July 5th in various cities, and the call for clarity on if it was a homophobic hate crime.

The response to evaluate mentions the protest against Samuel Luiz's murder, his age (24), his role as a nurse, the attack happening after leaving a nightclub, his death in the hospital from multiple blows, and the police investigation. It also includes some hashtags but no specific dates, locations beyond ""Galicia"" and ""A Coruña,"" and doesn't mention the 50+ protests or the call for clarification on the hate crime aspect.

Now, checking the 5W1H elements. The reference answer includes who (Samuel Luiz), what (protests against his murder), when (July 3rd and 5th), where (Galicia, A Coruña, Meicende, various cities), why (denouncing the murder and seeking clarity on if it was homophobic), how (protests, police investigation). 

The evaluated response covers who, what, where (some), when (partial), and why (partially). However, it misses the specific dates (July 3rd and 5th), the locations of the protests beyond ""Galicia"" and ""A Coruña,"" the mention of 50+ protests, the call for clarification on the hate crime, and the victim's background as a nurse. It also doesn't mention the police investigation details or the secret trial. 

So, it's missing several key elements from the source. According to the rubric, a score of 3 would be appropriate since the summary lacks several relevant Ws. The response doesn't fully cover all the important information required, which affects the score.
[/INST]
The response partially addresses the ""who,"" ""what,"" and ""where"" elements but omits critical details such as the specific dates (July 3 and 5), the exact locations of the protests (e.g., Coruña, Compostela, Vigo, etc.), the call for clarification on whether the crime was homophobic, and the victim's profession and background. It also lacks the ""why"" (denouncing the murder and seeking justice) and ""how"" (police investigation and secret trial). [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on maintaining all important information from the source using the 5W1H criteria (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). The reference answer scores a 5, so I need to compare the response to that.

First, I'll break down the original instruction. The main points are: the CIG union is criticizing the Consellaría for reducing 109 units and 155 teachers, the numbers come from a document published on the previous Saturday (which is the 4th of August, 2021), the specific areas affected (infantil, primary, special education), the reasons given by the union (falsifying figures, lack of negotiation, pandemic context), the proposed actions by the union (calls for more efforts, possible collective resignation, plans for September actions), and the government's stance (claiming more units than before the pandemic, sufficient resources).

Now, looking at the response to evaluate. It mentions the CIG denouncing the reduction of 109 units and 150 teachers, the recut affecting around 100 schools in infantil, primary, and special education. It also notes the government's defense that there will be more units than before the pandemic but admits some lines will be eliminated. The CNTE accuses the government of lacking sensitivity during the pandemic. They call for mobilization against these measures in the coming months. However, the source mentions specific dates (9th of August, 4th of August) and specific actions by CIG (collective resignation, September actions), which the response doesn't include. Also, the response refers to CNTE instead of CIG, which is a mistake. 

For the rubric, the 5W1H includes who (CIG, CNTE), what (reduction of units and teachers), when (specific dates), where (Galicia, specific educational levels), why (lack of negotiation, pandemic context), how (actions like mobilization, collective resignation). The reference answer includes all these elements. The evaluated response misses some key elements: the specific dates (when), the exact number of teachers (150 vs. 155), the mention of the pandemic context, and the specific actions like collective resignation and September mobilizations. It also misattributes the union (CNTE instead of CIG). 

So, applying the rubric: Score 1 would mean no relevant Ws, which isn't the case here. Score 2 is 1-2 Ws, but the response has several. Score 3 means missing several, which fits as several Ws are missing. Score 4 is missing one. Since the response misses multiple Ws (like specific dates, exact numbers, pandemic context, specific actions), it's more aligned with score 3. Therefore, the final score should be 3.
[/INST]
(1) The response fails to include the specific date (9 de agosto) when the CIG denounced the reduction, which is critical for the ""When"" element. [RESULT] 3  
(2) The response omits the exact number of teachers affected (150) and mentions ""perto dun cento"" instead, which slightly distorts the ""What"" detail. [RESULT] 3  
(3) The response does not specify the educational levels (infantil, primaria, educación especial) affected, missing the ""Where"" element. [RESULT] 3  
(4) The response incorrectly attributes the accusation to CNTE instead of CIG and omits the specific action of ""dimisión en bloque,"" which is part of the ""How"" element. [RESULT] 3  
(5) The response includes the main cause (lack of negotiation during the pandemic) and the government's stance, covering the ""Why"" and ""How"" aspects partially. [RESULT] 4",4.0

The response mentions key elements like the victim being attacked by her partner with a knife, the police pursuing the perpetrator, and the community condemning the attack. It also references protests and demonstrations. However, it lacks specific details about the time, location, and other critical elements such as the name of the victim, the specific organization involved, the political context (like the candidate status of the perpetrator), and the details of the victim's injuries or the medical response. The summary does not capture the full scope of the incident, including the multiple protests organized in nearby cities and the involvement of local authorities. The response is quite brief and does not adequately convey the full context and implications of the event as described in the source.

The response addresses some of the key points but misses several important details that were present in the source text. Therefore, the score is 3 because it lacks several relevant Ws from the original text.

The response includes essential details such as who (Biden and Trump), what (election results, legal challenges), when (one day after the elections), where (key states like Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Georgia, etc.), why (legal challenges and fraud claims), and how (voting methods like early and mail-in voting). [RESULT] 5 [/INST]

[/INST] [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to check if the response maintains all important information from the source text according to the 5W1H criteria. 

First, I need to recall the source text. It's about the U.S. presidential election results one day after the elections, discussing the uncertainty about the new president. It mentions Trump initially seeming strong but Biden gaining ground with wins in Michigan and Wisconsin, leading to 253 vs. 214 votes. It also talks about ongoing recounts, legal challenges by Trump, and key states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina. The focus is on the uncertainty and the legal battles.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate. It mentions the situation of the U.S. elections, Biden's increased chances despite Trump's initial lead, the wins in Michigan and Wisconsin giving 26 electoral votes, the current counts (253 vs. 214), Trump's legal challenges, and the key states where the recount is ongoing. It also notes Biden's lead in Arizona and Nevada.

Next, compare this to the reference answer, which scores a 5. The reference answer includes who (Biden and Trump), what (election results, legal challenges), when (one day after), where (key states), why (legal challenges and fraud claims), and how (voting methods like early and mail-in). 

The evaluated response covers all these points. It mentions who the candidates are, what happened (results, legal challenges), when (after the elections), where (key states), why (legal challenges), and how (voting methods). There's no missing crucial info. The response doesn't omit any key elements from the source text. Therefore, it meets all the 5W1H criteria. 

So, the score should be 5.

The response effectively captures all the key elements from the source text. It clearly states the event (when, where, what) by mentioning the ""quinta edición do Clúster TIC Capital Network"" held in Compostela on the previous Friday. It identifies the purpose (why) of the forum, which is to connect innovative projects with investors and support EBT companies. The response includes the number of projects selected (nine out of fourteen) and the total investment required (four million euros). It also mentions the ongoing annual process and the various stages of development of the projects.

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the 5W1H rubric. First, I need to make sure I understand the original text and the reference answer. The original text is about Irene, a 35-year-old woman from Vigo, who was aggressed by two men collecting signatures for the Porto Cabral macrocenter project. The incident happened on October 31st near Praza da Independencia. The summary needs to include all the key elements: who, what, when, where, why, and how.

Looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions Irene, her age, the date (October 31st), the location (Praza da Independencia), the event (aggression by two men collecting signatures), the reason (supporting the macrocenter), and the outcome (police intervention). However, it doesn't explicitly mention the ""why"" aspect, which is the reason behind the aggression—specifically, the motive related to the campaign against her not signing the petition. Also, the response doesn't fully cover the ""how"" in terms of the details of the attack, like the physical altercation, the police not being called, and the other incidents reported by others.

The reference answer (score 5) includes all the Ws and Hs. It mentions the who (Irene), what (aggression), when (October 31st), where (Praza da Independencia), why (campaign for the project), how (physical and verbal aggression, police intervention). It also covers the broader context of the project and the opposition.

The evaluated response misses some key elements. For instance, it doesn't detail the motive of the aggressors (the campaign against non-signers) and the full extent of the conflict, like the police not being called and the other women's experiences. So according to the rubric, if it's missing several relevant Ws, that would be a lower score. The rubric says score 3 is when the summary lacks several relevant Ws. Therefore, the score should be 3. The feedback should highlight that the summary missed several important Ws like the reason (why) and the how details.
[/INST]

The response covers the who (Irene), what (aggression), when (October 31st), and where (Praza da Independencia), but lacks critical details on the why (motive related to the campaign against non-signers) and how (specifics of the physical confrontation, police not being called, and broader context of intimidation). It also omits key elements like the legal implications, the project's impact on communal land, and the collective testimonies of other women. These omissions result in a significant gap in maintaining all relevant Ws from the source. [RESULT] 3",3.0

[INST] 5W1H: What, Who, When, Where, Why, How.

For the feedback part, you should give detailed feedback per each of the Ws in 5W1H. The rubric says the summary should have all the important information (the Ws) from the original text. Therefore, if the summary has all the important Ws, then the score is 5. If one is missing, score is 4. If two or more are missing, score is 3. If three or more are missing, score is 2. If four or more are missing, score is 1.

### Now, let's begin the thinking process. 
Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the 5W1H criteria. First, I'll check each of the Ws to see if they are all included.

What: The response mentions the debate over the high-speed rail connection between Lisbon-Porto-Vigo, the Spanish government opposing the Atlantic axis and favoring Madrid-Lisboa, and the Portuguese government insisting on Lisbon-Porto-Vigo as priority. That's covered.

Who: The Spanish government (Pedro Sánchez, Sergio Vázquez Torrón) and Portuguese government (António Costa, Ana Abrunhosa, Nuno Santos) are identified. Good.

When: It mentions October 2020, the 31st Ibero-Portuguese Summit, the end of October meetings in Cerveira-Tomiño, and the preparation of the 2021 State Budget and Portugal's National Investment Plan 2030. That's covered.

Where: Spain (Madrid, Vigo) and Portugal (Lisboa, Porto, Braga, Valença) are mentioned. Also includes meetings in Cerveira-Tomiño and the Ibero-Portuguese Summit. Covered.

Why: The Spanish government doesn't want to assume the cost of around 200 million euros for the Vigo-Portugal connection and prefers Madrid-Lisboa. Portugal considers the Atlantic axis (Lisboa-Porto-Vigo) as logical due to economic and cultural ties with Galicia. This is included.

How: The Spanish government refused to include budget funding and pressured Portugal to accept Madrid-Lisboa as central. The Portuguese government includes the project in its 2030 National Investment Plan, financed by European funds, and commits to advancing the Lisbon-Porto and Porto-Vigo segments. This is also included.

All 5W1H elements are covered in the response. So the score should be 5.

gpt5-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response needs to be assessed based on the rubric provided. 

First, I'll look at the reference answer which scores a 5. It includes all the necessary elements: who (Avante LGTBI+), what (concentrations to denounce the murder), when (5 July at 20:00, and the murder on July 3), where (multiple cities in Galicia), why (to denounce the murder and seek justice), and how (through simultaneous gatherings). The reference answer covers all the Ws without missing any important details.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate. Let's break down each W:

What: The response mentions the protests against the murder and the demand for clarity on if it was an LGBTphobic crime. That's covered.

Who: It mentions Avante LGTBI+ as the organizer, participants as citizens and social groups, and the victim, Samuel Luiz. This seems comprehensive.

When: It states the protests on July 5th at 20:00 and notes the murder happened on July 3rd around 3 AM. Both dates are included, so this is covered.

Where: It lists over 50 locations across Galicia, including cities and towns. The reference answer also lists many places, so this is addressed.

Why: The response includes denouncing the murder, seeking justice, and highlighting possible LGBTphobic motives. The reference answer mentions similar points, so this is covered.

How: It explains the gatherings organized by Avante LGTBI+ in public spaces. The reference answer also mentions the simultaneous gatherings. So, how is included.

Wait, but the response does mention ""how"" by explaining the method of simultaneous gatherings. The reference answer doesn't explicitly state ""how,"" but it implies it through the mention of organized gatherings. However, the response here explicitly addresses ""how,"" which the reference answer might not. But the rubric is about maintaining all important information from the source, not just the Ws. 

Looking back, the original text mentions the method of ""concentraciones simultáneas"" organized by Avante LGTBI+. The response includes that detail, which is part of the ""how."" The reference answer doesn't explicitly state ""how,"" but maybe it's implied through the mention of the locations and the organization. However, the rubric focuses on the Ws, so the key is whether each W is present. 

The response includes all six Ws: what, who, when, where, why, and how. The reference answer might have omitted the ""how"" explicitly but included it implicitly. However, according to the rubric, the score is based on whether all relevant Ws are present. If the response includes all six, then it should score a 5. The reference answer might not have explicitly stated ""how,"" but the response here does. Therefore, the response should score a 5. However, maybe the reference answer's ""how"" is implied, so the response here is more complete. 

Wait, the reference answer says ""convocadas por Avante LGTBI+"" which implies the method, but not explicitly ""how."" The response here explicitly states ""A través de concentracións simultáneas organizadas..."" which directly addresses ""how."" Therefore, the response includes all six Ws, making it a 5. The rubric states that a 5 requires all relevant Ws. So the answer should be 5.
[/INST] (The response comprehensively covers all six components of the 5W1H method: What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. Each element is clearly addressed with specific details from the original text, ensuring no critical information is omitted. The summary maintains the essential information about the event, organizers, timing, locations, reasons, and methods without any gaps or inaccuracies.)

gpt5-5w1h,Failed to generate feedback,
gpt5-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's start by understanding the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the 5W1H method using the given rubric. The instruction was to summarize the text using what, who, when, where, why, and how. The response provided by the user includes all these elements, but I need to check if they are all covered.

First, looking at the response: 

- ""Que"" covers ""what"" – the reduction of units and teachers.
- ""Quen"" covers ""who"" – the CIG and the Consellaría.
- ""Cando"" covers ""when"" – August 9th, 2021.
- ""Onde"" covers ""where"" – Galicia, public education sectors.
- ""Por que"" covers ""why"" – manipulation of numbers, treating education as a cost, ignoring negotiations, pandemic context.
- ""Como"" covers ""how"" – public denunciation, calling for mobilization, possible resignation, planned actions in September.

The reference answer (score 5) includes all the Ws, but the response here also includes all. Wait, the rubric says that a score of 5 is when all relevant Ws are present. So the response here does include all six elements. However, I need to check if any are missing or not properly addressed. 

Wait, the response mentions ""how"" with the actions taken by CIG. The reference answer doesn't mention ""how,"" but the user's response does. So the user's response meets the criteria for all 5W1H elements. Therefore, according to the rubric, this should be a score of 5. But wait, the reference answer might have missed some details. Let me double-check. The user's response includes all six Ws, so the score should be 5. But the rubric says score 5 is when all relevant Ws are present. Therefore, the feedback should state that all Ws are covered, hence a 5. 

But I need to make sure that none of the elements are missing. For example, ""how"" is covered by the actions taken by the CIG. The ""when"" is specified as August 9th, which is correct. The ""where"" is Galicia. The ""why"" includes the reasons given by the sindicato. All elements are there. So the score should be 5.
[/INST]

The response comprehensively addresses all six elements of the 5W1H method (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) as required. It clearly identifies the action (What), the involved parties (Who), the timeline (When), the location (Where), the reasons behind the criticism (Why), and the methods of response (How). Each component is explicitly covered without omission or ambiguity, aligning fully with the reference answer's structure and depth. [RESULT] 5",5.0

It covers the event (when, where, what), the participants (who), the purpose (why), and the financial aspect (how much and what it's for). However, it does not include the detailed description of each project, which was part of the original content. Despite this omission, the core information about the event, the number of projects, the investment sought, and the overall goal are well represented.

Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the 5W1H rubric. The reference answer scores a 5, so I should check if the response includes all the necessary elements.

First, the response mentions the perpetrator (who): ""Un home apuñalou a súa parella, Montse López..."" That covers who. The action (what): ""apuñalou"" is clear. When: ""o mércores 15 de maio pola mañá."" Where: ""diante da oficina de Unións Agrarias en Vimianzo."" How: ""propinou tres puñaladas, unha delas no pescozo"" which explains the method. Also, it mentions the victim's condition (gravemente ferida), the perpetrator's age and profession (41 años, fontaneiro), and the responses from authorities and organizations. All key points from the source are included. The reference answer also includes all these elements, so the response meets the 5W1H criteria. Therefore, it deserves a 5.

Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric is about maintaining all important information from the source text, specifically the 5W1H elements (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How). The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being the best.

First, I'll look at the original text. The key points are:

- The Real Academia Galega has made millions of pages available online via publicacions.academia.gal since 1906.
- The website allows users to access over 350 volumes, 200 in PDF format.
- It was launched with a press conference attended by the president, secretary, and IT department heads.
- The project aims to promote universal access to their heritage using communication technologies.
- They plan to increase the number of titles available.
- The website includes specific publications like speeches, toponymy volumes, meeting acts, and anthologies.
- It complements existing periodic publications.

Now, the response to evaluate is: ""Milleiros de páxinas editadas pola Real Academia Galega xa están dispoñíbeis nun novo espazo web da institución, publicacions.academia.gal, para facilitar a consulta e o acesso directo a un importante número de títulos.""

Let me break down what's included here. The response mentions the number of pages (milleiros), the institution (Real Academia Galega), the website (publicacions.academia.gal), the purpose (facilitar a consulta e o acceso directo), and the number of titles (importante número). However, it's missing several key elements from the original text.

Looking at the 5W1H:
- Who: Real Academia Galega is mentioned, but the attendees at the press conference (president, secretary, etc.) are omitted.
- What: The availability of pages and the website are covered, but details about the 350 volumes, 200 in PDF, and specific publications like speeches and toponymy volumes are missing.
- When: The year 1906 is mentioned, but the press conference date (segunda feira) isn't included.
- Where: The website domain is provided, but the location of the academy isn't specified.
- Why: The goal of promoting universal access is mentioned, but the mention of using communication technologies is absent.
- How: The project's use of free software tools (Public Knowledge Project) isn't included, nor the functionalities like managing submissions and producing PDFs.

The reference answer (score 5) includes most of these elements, but the evaluated response misses several key points. For example, it doesn't mention the 350 volumes, the PDF availability, the press conference attendees, specific publications, or the project's technical aspects. Therefore, it lacks several relevant Ws. According to the rubric, this would fall under Score 3: the summary lacks several relevant Ws. So the score should be 3.
[/INST]
The response mentions the Real Academia Galega's new website (publicacions.academia.gal) and the availability of ""milleiros de páxinas"" (millions of pages) since 1906, covering the ""what"" and ""when."" It briefly touches on the purpose (""facilitar a consulta e o acesso directo""), but crucial details like the number of volumes (350), the 200 downloadable PDFs, specific publications (speeches, toponymy volumes, etc.), the press conference attendees, the project's goals (universal access to heritage), and the use of free software tools are entirely omitted. These elements are critical for a comprehensive summary.

[INST] Okay, let's start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric is about maintaining all important information from the source text, specifically the 5W1H elements (who, what, when, where, why, how). The reference answer scores a 5, so I should compare the evaluated response to that.

First, I'll look at the original text. The main points are about the Spanish government's disinterest in the Lisbon-Vigo rail connection. Key elements include the opposition from Sergio Vázquez Torrón, the refusal to fund studies in 2021, the blame shifting between governments, the cost of the project (~200 million euros), the pressure from Spain to halt the project, the Portuguese minister Ana Abrunhosa's statements during the Iberian Summit, the focus on the Atlantic axis, the plan to connect Lisbon to Porto and Porto to Vigo, funding from EU recovery funds, and specific details like reducing travel time by 20 minutes and the 2030 investment plan.

Now, the evaluated response includes the Spanish government's disinterest, the opposition from Vázquez Torrón, the refusal to fund the study in 2021, and the mention of the 200 million euro cost. However, it misses several key points from the reference answer. For example, it doesn't mention the pressure from Spain on Portugal, Ana Abrunhosa's role, the focus on the Atlantic axis, the EU funding, the 2030 plan, or the reduction in travel time. It also omits the context of the Iberian Summit and the specific details about the investment plans and the 20-minute reduction. 

Looking at the rubric, a score of 5 requires all relevant Ws. The response here only covers a few elements (what, who, maybe why) but misses most of the other crucial information. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for a 5. Since it's missing multiple important points, it might fall into the 3 or 4 category. But since it's missing several key elements, a 3 seems more accurate. However, the rubric says score 3 is for lacking several relevant Ws. Wait, the evaluated response actually includes some elements but not all. The reference answer has all, so the evaluated response is missing several. So according to the rubric, score 3 would be appropriate because it lacks several important Ws. However, I need to check if it's missing more than just a few. Let me recount: the response includes who (Spanish government, Vázquez), what (disinterest, refusal to fund), why (cost, pressure), but misses when (specific dates like 2021, the Iberian Summit in October), where (the specific routes mentioned), how (funding from EU, the 2030 plan). So there are multiple Ws missing. Therefore, the score should be 3.
[/INST]

The response captures some key elements like the Spanish government's disinterest, the opposition from Sergio Vázquez Torrón, the refusal to fund the study in 2021, and the 200 million euro cost. However, it significantly omits critical details such as the pressure from Spain on Portugal, Ana Abrunhosa’s role in the Iberian Summit, the focus on the Atlantic axis, the EU funding plan, the 2030 investment roadmap, and specific travel time reductions. These omissions indicate a lack of several important ""who,"" ""what,"" ""where,"" and ""how"" elements. [RESULT] 3",3.0
llama3-base," [INST]Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric is about maintaining all important information from the source text using the 5W1H framework. 

First, I'll check the reference answer which scored a 5. It mentions the organization (Avante LGTBI+), the number of rallies (over 50), the cause (denouncing the murder of Samuel Luiz and demanding clarity on if it was homophobic), the victim's details (24 years old, from Meicende, died on July 3rd in A Coruña), the lack of arrests (under secrecy), and the locations (cities and towns listed). All these elements cover the key points from the original text.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: ""A denúncia do asasinato de Samuel Luiz."" This translates to ""The denunciation of the murder of Samuel Luiz."" It's very brief and only mentions the main event—Samuel Luiz's murder. However, it lacks crucial details from the source text. 

The rubric requires maintaining all relevant Ws (who, what, when, where, why, how). The response doesn't mention the organization (Avante LGTBI+), the number of rallies, the victim's age, location, or the ongoing investigation details. It also doesn't include the locations of the rallies. The reference answer included all these elements, so the response here is missing most of them. 

According to the rubric, a score of 1 would be for no relevant Ws, but here there's some mention (what and who), but not enough. The response only covers the ""what"" (the denunciation) and ""who"" (Samuel Luiz), but misses the rest. So, this would fall under a lower score. 

The response doesn't meet the criteria for a 5, 4, or even 3. It lacks several relevant Ws. Therefore, the appropriate score would be 2, as it includes only 1-2 Ws.
[/INST]

The response only mentions the main event (the denunciation of Samuel Luiz's murder) but fails to include critical details such as the organizing group (Avante LGTBI+), the number of rallies, the victim's age and location, the date of the incident, the ongoing investigation status, and the locations of the protests. It lacks most of the essential ""who,"" ""what,"" ""when,"" ""where,"" ""why,"" and ""how"" elements required by the source text. [RESULT] 2",2.0

###Actually, you need to write the thinking process, not the output, and then stop. Don't provide the final answer yet. Please write out your thought process here. Let me see how you approach this.

Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The task is to check if the summary maintains all important information from the source text, specifically focusing on the 5W1H elements: who, what, when, where, why, how. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer which received a score of 5. Let me go through each part of the original text and see what details are included in the response.

The original text describes a gender-based violence case in Vimianzo, Spain, on March 15th at 9:00 AM. The victim is Montse López, a mother, attacked by her partner Javier M., who was a 41-year-old plumber and a former candidate for mayor. The attack involved three stab wounds, including the neck, and the victim was hospitalized by a medical helicopter. The police are pursuing him. The local council condemned the attack, held an extraordinary session, and organized rallies. Also, various organizations and political parties expressed solidarity.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions the case in Vimianzo, Galiza, Spain. It states the time as 9:00 AM, the attacker's name, his profession, and that he was a candidate for mayor. It notes the victim's name and her status as a mother, the stabbing, hospitalization, and police pursuit. It also includes the council's condemnation, the extraordinary session, and mentions political parties and organizations like PSdeG-PSOE and BNG expressing support.

The reference answer includes all these details and more specific times (13:30, 15:30, etc.), locations (Praza do Concello, Praza 8 de marzo, etc.), and the specific actions taken (sessions, rallies). 

The response to evaluate seems to cover all the key elements: who (victim and attacker), what (stabbing, hospitalization), when (time of attack, police actions), where (Vimianzo, locations of events), why (condemnation of machismo), and how (actions taken by authorities and organizations). However, it might be missing some specific details like exact times for the rallies, the exact name of the organization (Buserana), or the specific actions like the reading of a manifesto. But the rubric focuses on whether all relevant Ws are present, not on minor details. 

The response to evaluate does include all the essential elements required by the rubric. It covers all the main points without omitting critical information. Therefore, it should score a 5. The reference answer has a 5, and the evaluated response matches that standard.
[/INST] 

The response effectively captures all key elements (who, what, when, where, why, how) from the original text. It clearly identifies the victim (Montse López), the perpetrator (Javier M.), the location (Vimianzo, Galiza), the time (9:00 AM), the nature of the incident (stabbings, hospitalization), the institutional response (Concello's condemnation, extraordinary session), and the broader social context (political parties, organizations expressing solidarity). No critical information is omitted. [RESULT] 5 [RESULT] 5",5.0

llama3-base," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the provided rubric. The rubric focuses on maintaining all important information from the source text, specifically the 5W1H elements: who, what, when, where, why, how.

First, I need to compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer that scored 5. The reference answer includes details about Ana Peleteiro, her achievement (bronze medal in women's triple jump), the event (Tokyo Olympics), her personal best (14.87 meters), the competition details (sixth and final jump, beating Jamaica's Rickets), and her significance as the first Galician athlete to win a medal in Tokyo. 

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: ""Ana Peleteiro, de Ribeira, conquistou a primeira medalla olímpica para o atletismo galego, conseguindo a medalla de bronce no triplo salto feminino."" This response mentions who (Ana Peleteiro), what (won a bronze medal in women's triple jump), where (atletismo galego, which refers to Galician athletics), and why (first Olympic medal for Galician athletics). However, it lacks key details like when (the event, which is the Tokyo Olympics), where (the location, which is Tokyo, but maybe implied), and how (the specific jump details, her personal record, and the competition against other athletes). 

The rubric requires all relevant Ws to be included. The response doesn't mention the Olympics (when and where), nor the specific jump details (how she achieved it, her personal best, and the competitors). These elements are crucial for a comprehensive summary. Therefore, the response misses several important Ws, leading to a lower score. The reference answer includes all these elements, hence the score of 5. The evaluated response, while mentioning some key points, omits essential information, so it doesn't meet the 5W1H criteria fully. 

Based on the rubric, if the summary lacks several relevant Ws, that's a score of 3. But wait, the rubric says Score 3 is when the summary lacks several relevant Ws. However, the evaluated response might be missing more than just a few. Let me check again. The response doesn't mention the Olympics (when and where), her personal best (how), and the competitors (who she beat). That's multiple Ws missing. So according to the rubric, that would be a score of 3. However, I should make sure I'm not missing any other elements. The reference answer includes all, so the evaluated response is missing several, which aligns with Score 3. But wait, the rubric says Score 3 is when several relevant Ws are missing, which matches here. Therefore, the score should be 3.
[/INST]

The response mentions the key elements of ""who"" (Ana Peleteiro), ""what"" (bronze medal in triple jump), and ""why"" (first Galician Olympic medal). However, it fails to include critical details such as ""when"" (Tokyo Olympics), ""where"" (location of the event), and ""how"" (specific jump performance, personal best, and competitors like Rickets and Rojas). These omissions significantly reduce the completeness of the summary. [RESULT] 3",3.0

llama3-5w1h," (Please write your answer in English.) [INST]Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the 5W1H criteria. First, I need to check if all the Ws (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) are covered in the response.

Looking at the original text, the key points are: the uncertainty about the new president, Biden's lead after Trump's initial advantage, the states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and others where the counting is ongoing, the legal challenges by Trump, and the need for 270 electoral votes. 

The response provided has: ""O novo presidente dos Estados Unidos."" That covers ""Who"" (new president). ""O candidato do Partido Demócrata, Joe Biden."" Also ""Who"" and maybe ""What"". ""Un día despois das eleccións."" That's ""When"". ""Nos Estados Unidos."" ""Where"". ""Porque aínda non se conta o voto anticipado..."" which is ""Why"". And ""Porque Joe Biden está gañando..."" which might be part of the ""How"" or ""Why"". 

Wait, the 5W1H includes What, Who, When, Where, Why, and How. The reference answer includes all these. The response here mentions ""Who"" (Biden), ""When"" (one day after elections), ""Where"" (US), ""Why"" (voting still pending, Biden leading), but does it cover ""What"" (the event of the election results)? It starts with ""O novo presidente"", which is the result, so that's part of ""What"". ""How"" is missing? The response doesn't explain how Biden is achieving the lead, just that he's winning. So ""How"" isn't addressed. 

So according to the rubric, Score 4 is for missing one W. Since ""How"" is missing, that would be a 4. But wait, the user's rubric says Score 4 is missing one relevant W. So if ""How"" is missing, then the score is 4. But maybe ""How"" isn't explicitly required? The original text talks about how the recount is happening, but the response doesn't mention that. So the response is missing ""How"". Therefore, the score should be 4. The feedback should note that the response missed the ""How"" element.
[/INST]

The response addresses most of the 5W1H elements but misses the ""how"" component, which refers to the methodology or process of how Biden is gaining momentum (e.g., winning key states, legal challenges). While ""why"" is partially covered, the explanation is incomplete. [RESULT] 4",4.0

llama3-5w1h," (evaluate based on the score rubric) [RESULT] (a score of 1 to 5)

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate is provided, and I need to check if it covers all the necessary elements: Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How. 

First, looking at the response. The user starts with ""Quen: Irene, unha muller de 35 anos de Vigo."" So Who is covered. Then ""Cando: O 31 de outubro."" That's When. ""Onde: Nas inmediacións da Praza da Independencia."" That's Where. ""Por que: Irene foi obxecto dunha agresión..."" which addresses Why. Then ""Como: Irene achegouse onda eles..."" which covers How. So all six elements are present here.

Now, checking the reference answer which scores a 5. It includes all the Ws and H. The response to evaluate also includes all the Ws and H. However, I need to check if there's any missing important information. 

Wait, the reference answer mentions additional details like the location of the macrocenter, the 300 meters of communal land, the opposition from the community, the police intervention, and other women's experiences. The response being evaluated doesn't include those details. But according to the rubric, the score is based on whether all the relevant Ws are present. The rubric's score 5 requires that all relevant Ws from the source are included. The response does cover all the Ws (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) as per the 5W1H. The extra details in the reference answer are part of the content but not strictly part of the 5W1H structure. Therefore, the response meets the rubric's criteria for a score of 5. 

But wait, the rubric's score 5 is about maintaining all important information from the source. Wait, the rubric says ""maintenance of all important information (the Ws in 5W1H - who, what, when, where, why, how) from the source document."" So the focus is on the 5W1H elements. The response does include all six elements. Therefore, even though it doesn't include the extra details like the community opposition or other victims, it still meets the rubric's criteria because the 5W1H elements are all present. So the score should be 5.
[/INST]
The response correctly identifies all six elements of the 5W1H (Who, What, When, Where, Why, How) from the source text. It clearly states Irene as the victim, the date (31 October), the location (Praza da Independencia), the reason (aggression over refusing to sign a petition), and the method (her interaction with the aggressors leading to physical confrontation). No critical W elements are missing. [RESULT] 5",5.0

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on maintaining all important information from the source using the 5W1H criteria. 

First, I need to recall the source text. The key points include: the event happened two weeks after the murder of Jimmy, 36 people were detained, they were part of the Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys, some were active military or police, the attack involved a mallet and throwing him into the river, the investigation is looking into whether the attack was planned, there's a political controversy over security errors, and the impact on the sports community.

Now, the response to evaluate mentions the two weeks after the murder, 36 detentions, the involvement of Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys, the two suspected killers being a military person and a Guardia Civil agent, and the theory that the ultras were waiting to attack. It also touches on the investigation into preparation and the perpetrators.

The reference answer (score 5) includes all the Ws: who (detained individuals, involved parties), what (detentions, investigation), when (two weeks after the murder), where (Madrid and Xixón), why (security failures, political pressure), how (investigation methods, police actions). It also covers the outcome and consequences.

Comparing the evaluated response to the rubric: It covers who (detained individuals), what (detentions, investigation), when (two weeks after), where (Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys), why (planned attack, security issues). However, it doesn't mention the specific details about the mallet, the river, the security controversies from Coruña, the pressure to ban ultras, or the stadium seating issues. The response also misses the mention of minors, women, and various professions among the detainees, which are part of the source text. 

The rubric scores 5 for covering all Ws. The evaluated response misses several key points like the method of attack (mallet), the location of the incident (river), the political aspects (security failures, pressure from authorities), and the community impact. Therefore, it doesn't meet the 5 criteria but covers more than 4. However, since it's missing several, it might fall into a lower score. Wait, the rubric says 5 is all Ws, 4 is lacking one. The evaluated response lacks multiple Ws, so maybe a 3? Wait, the rubric says Score 3 is ""lacks several relevant Ws."" So if the response has some but misses several, it would be a 3. But wait, the evaluated response does cover most of the Ws except for the specifics on the attack method, the security controversies, and the community impact. So maybe it's a 4? Let me check again. The reference answer includes all, so the evaluated response is missing a few. For example, the how part (investigation methods, use of cameras and phones), the why (security failures, pressure), the where (Madrid and Xixón), and the what (specific charges, investigation into planning). The evaluated response mentions the investigation into planning but not the specific details. It also doesn't mention the security controversies or the community impact. So, it's missing several Ws, which would be a 3. But the response does include most of the main points. Hmm. The user's response includes the key elements: when, where, who, what, and the why (investigation into planned attack). The missing parts are the specific details about the attack method, security failures, and community impact. So according to the rubric, that would be a 3 because it lacks several relevant Ws. Therefore, the score should be 3.
[/INST]
The response provides a concise overview of the key elements: who (detained individuals), what (detentions and investigation), when (two weeks after the murder), and where (Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys). It also touches on the why (planned attack theory). However, it lacks critical details such as the method of attack (mallet, river), the political controversy over security failures, the pressure to ban ultras, and the broader community impact. These elements are essential for a complete summary. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on maintaining all important information from the source using the 5W1H framework. 

First, I need to understand the original instruction and the reference answer. The main points in the source text include the festival's name (""Curtocircuíto 2021""), the dates (October 1-10), the theme of bringing different disciplines together, the director Yann González, the sections Púlsar and Sección Oficial with specific filmmakers, the interdisciplinary projects like Bandia Ribeira, Sau-Ching Wong, and Ak-zi-å, and the locations in Santiago de Compostela.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions the festival's name, the ""arriscada"" and interdisciplinary programming, and the ""punto de encontro de todas as artes."" However, it lacks specific details like the exact dates, the names of the sections, the specific artists involved, and the locations where activities will take place. 

The reference answer (score 5) includes all these elements: dates, festival name, key themes, the director, the sections, the number of films, the interdisciplinary aspects, and the locations. 

Applying the rubric: The response only covers the what (the program is risky and interdisciplinary) and the why (to bring together all arts). It misses the when, where, who (specific people and sections), and how (interdisciplinary projects and locations). Since it's missing multiple Ws, according to the rubric, this would be a score of 3. The feedback should highlight that the summary lacks several relevant Ws, specifically dates, specific individuals, sections, and locations.
[/INST]

The response mentions the festival's name and the general idea of an interdisciplinary, risky program but omits key details such as the specific dates, the sections (e.g., Púlsar, Sección Oficial), the number of films (39), the names of key figures (Yann González, Caroline Poggi, Bandia Ribeira), and the locations (Teatro Principal, Salón Teatro, Sala Númax). These elements are critical for a comprehensive summary. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the 5W1H rubric. Let's start by breaking down the original instruction and the reference answer. The main points are: the Real Academia Galega launched a new website (publicacions.academia.gal) where over 350 volumes edited since 1906 can be accessed. It mentions free PDF downloads, the presentation event with key figures like Víctor Freixanes, Henrique Monteagudo, Nélida Cosme, and Juan Montenegro. The purpose is to promote access to their heritage using communication technologies. They also mention the Public Knowledge Project, tools for academic publishing, and specific publications like discourses, Terra Nomeada, onomastics meetings, and anthologies about the Guild of Language.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: ""A Real Academia Galega (RAG) presentou un novo portal web, publicacions.academia.gal, onde se poden consultar máis de 350 volumes editados pola institución desde 1906."" 

This response includes 'who' (RAG), 'what' (new portal), 'when' (since 1906), 'where' (publicacions.academia.gal), and 'why' (access to heritage). It mentions the number of volumes (350) and the timeframe (since 1906). However, it misses the 'how' part, which in the original text refers to the Public Knowledge Project and the use of open-source tools. Also, it doesn't mention the key people involved in the presentation or the specific publications listed. 

The reference answer includes all the Ws: who, what, when, where, why, and how. It mentions the people, the project, the goal, the tools, and the specific content. 

So, the evaluated response lacks 'how' and several other details. Therefore, it doesn't meet the criteria for a score of 5. The closest score would be 3, as it covers some but not all important Ws.

Okay, let me evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The task is to check if all the 5W1H elements (who, what, when, where, why, how) are maintained from the source document.

First, looking at the response: 

- **Who**: It mentions ""A Consellaría de Cultura, Educación e Universidade da Xunta de Galicia"" and ""a central sindical nacionalista CIG"", so that's covered. 
- **What**: It talks about the criticism, the reduction of units and teachers, and the government's defense. So 'what' is there.
- **When**: The original text mentions ""esta segunda feira, 9 de agosto"" and ""pasada sexta feira"". The response doesn't mention the specific dates. That's missing.
- **Where**: The original text refers to Galicia and the Xunta de Galicia. The response mentions ""Xunta de Galicia"" but doesn't specify the location beyond that. Maybe that's covered, but it's a bit vague.
- **Why**: The reason given in the original is that the government is ""xogando"" with numbers to mislead the public and not investing in education. The response mentions the criticism but not the exact reasons like the pandemic context and the lack of dialogue. 
- **How**: The original describes the specific actions like the elimination of 127 and creation of 19 units. The response doesn't go into the specifics of how the changes are structured.

The reference answer (score 5) includes all the Ws, including when (9 de agosto), why (xogar coas cifras, pandemia, falta de diálogo), and how (eliminación de 127, creación de 19). The response to evaluate only includes who and what, missing when, where, why, and how. Therefore, according to the rubric, this would be a score of 2.

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation step by step. The task is to assess the response based on the provided rubric, which focuses on maintaining all important information from the source text (the 5W1H elements). 

First, I need to understand the original instruction and the reference answer. The instruction is a news article about two incidents: a letter with bullets sent to Isabel Díaz Ayuso (president of Madrid) and another to Carmen Gámez (head of the Civil Guard). The reference answer scores a 5 because it includes all the key details: who (Díaz Ayuso and Gámez), what (letter with bullets), when (this Tuesday), where (Barcelona and Madrid), why (threats), and how (intercepted by Mossos d'Esquadra, unknown sender, etc.).

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: ""Os Mossos d' Esquadra investigan o envío dunha carta con balas dirixida á presidenta da Comunidade de Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso."" This translates to: ""The Mossos d'Esquadra are investigating the sending of a letter with bullets directed to the president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso.""

Breaking down the 5W1H elements in the source:
- **Who**: Mossos d'Esquadra, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, Carmen Gámez.
- **What**: Letters with bullets, interception, threats.
- **When**: This Tuesday (terza feira, which is Wednesday, but the reference answer says ""este martes,"" so there might be a discrepancy here).
- **Where**: Barcelona (where the bullets were detected), Madrid (second package).
- **Why**: Threats, possible motives.
- **How**: Intercepted by Correos, no sender, type of projectiles, messages, etc.

The response to evaluate mentions:
- **Who**: Mossos d'Esquadra and Isabel Díaz Ayuso.
- **What**: Letter with bullets.
- **Where**: Not explicitly mentioned (the source says Barcelona and Madrid, but the response doesn't specify locations beyond the president's name).
- **When**: Not mentioned (the source mentions ""nas últimas horas desta terza feira"" which is Wednesday, but the reference answer says ""este martes,"" which is Tuesday. However, the exact day might be less critical than the time frame).
- **Why**: Not mentioned (the response doesn't include the context of threats or the president's reaction).
- **How**: Not mentioned (details like interception process, unknown sender, type of projectiles, etc. are missing).

The reference answer includes all these elements, hence the score of 5. The response to evaluate is missing key elements: the second package to Carmen Gámez, the location details (Barcelona and Madrid), the time frame, the reason (threats), and the method (interception by Correos, unknown sender, type of projectiles). Therefore, it lacks several relevant Ws, which according to the rubric, would score lower. Specifically, it misses multiple Ws, leading to a score of 3. But wait, the rubric states:
- Score 1: No relevant Ws.
- Score 2: 1-2 Ws.
- Score 3: Lacks several relevant Ws.
- Score 4: Lacking one relevant W.
- Score 5: All Ws.

The response includes some Ws (who, what) but misses several (where, when, why, how). So it's missing more than one, which would be a 3. However, if ""when"" is partially covered (though the day is slightly off), and ""where"" is partially mentioned (the president's location), maybe it's still missing several. Hence, the score should be 3.
[/INST]
The response fails to include critical elements such as the second intercepted package addressed to Carmen Gámez, the locations (Barcelona and Madrid), the time frame (intercepted in the last hours of Wednesday), the reason (threats), and the method (interception by Correos, unknown sender, type of projectiles). It only mentions the main event (letter with bullets) and the involved parties (Mossos d'Esquadra and Díaz Ayuso).

""The response correctly identifies that Ana Peleteiro won a bronze medal in the women's triple jump at the Tokyo Olympics, which covers the 'who', 'what', and 'where' elements. However, it does not mention the 'why' (the significance of this being her first Olympic medal for a Galician athlete) or the 'how' (the details of her performance, such as breaking her personal record, surpassing competitors, and the specific distance achieved). Additionally, the 'when' (the specific event or year, though implicitly mentioned as Tokyo 2020) is partially addressed. The response lacks critical details about her achievement and the context of her performance, making it incomplete according to the rubric. [RESULT] 3"" [/INST]

""The response captures the key elements of who (Ana Peleteiro), what (won a bronze medal in the women's triple jump), and where (Tokyo Olympics).
