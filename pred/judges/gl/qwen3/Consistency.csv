salamandra-base," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing detailed feedback based on specific criteria. The main goal is to assess the response against the given reference answer and score rubric, which focuses on factual consistency.

So, the instruction was to summarize a text about the murder of Samuel Luiz in Galicia, with various protests planned. The response to evaluate is provided, and the reference answer scores a 5. The rubric is about consistency—whether the summary aligns with the source text without hallucinating facts.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer includes key points: Avante LGTBI+ organized over 50 events, Samuel's age, his place of residence, the location and date of the murder, the police investigation under secrecy, and the cities where the protests are held.

Looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions the number of events (over 50), the locations (Coruña, Santiago, Vigo, Ferrol), the time of the crime (night of the previous Saturday in Coruña), the police investigation under secrecy, and the solidarity with the family and friends. However, it adds details like participants wearing white shirts with designs and holding banners with ""Samuel, presente,"" which aren't in the original text. Also, it mentions ""social and political organizations promoting the events,"" which isn't explicitly stated. 

The rubric penalizes hallucinated facts. The response includes elements not present in the original text, such as the clothing and banners, and the promotion by social and political organizations. These are additions not found in the source. The reference answer doesn't mention these, so they are hallucinations. Therefore, the response has incorrect information, which affects the score. 

The score rubric states that a 5 is fully factual. Since there are hallucinations, the score would be lower. The response has several incorrect pieces, so maybe a 3? But wait, the reference answer also mentions the 50 events, which the response does include correctly. However, the added details are incorrect. So the response has several incorrect pieces, leading to a 3. But wait, the user's example might have different nuances. Let me check again. The response includes some correct info but adds extra details not in the source. According to the rubric, score 3 is for several incorrect pieces. So the final score would be 3. The feedback should note the hallucinated facts and the correct parts, leading to the score.
[/INST]

The response includes several hallucinated details not present in the original text, such as participants wearing white shirts with designs and holding banners with ""Samuel, presente,"" as well as the claim that the events are ""promovidas polas organizacións sociais e políticas galegas."" These additions contradict the source, which only mentions Avante LGTBI+ as the convocante. While the response correctly notes the number of events, locations, and the police investigation, the added information introduces inaccuracies. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's tackle this. The task is to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. The rubric focuses on consistency—whether the summary contains factual information from the source without hallucinations.

First, I need to compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer is a 5, so it's the ideal summary. The response to evaluate is about the attendees at the event, listing financial institutions and organizations. However, looking back at the original text, the main content was about the Cluster TIC Capital Network event, the projects presented, and the investment needed. The original text doesn't mention any specific attendees like ABANCA, CaixaBank, etc. The reference answer doesn't include these details either. 

Wait, the original text does mention that the forum brings together investors, including Spanish and foreign business angels, private investors in the TIC sector. But the response lists specific entities like ABANCA, Bankia, KPMG, etc. However, the original text might not have listed these exact names. Let me check again. The original text says ""investidores privados que operan no sector TIC"" and mentions ""business angels"" but doesn't list specific companies. The response includes entities like ABANCA, CaixaBank, KPMG, Deloitte, etc., which are not mentioned in the original text. Therefore, this is a hallucination. 

So, the summary contains information not present in the original source. According to the rubric, this would be a penalty. The reference answer only mentions the event, the number of projects, and their names, without listing attendees. Therefore, the evaluated response includes incorrect information, leading to a lower score. Since the response has hallucinated facts about attendees, it should get a lower score. The rubric says Score 1 is no ideas from original, Score 2 is a lot of incorrect info. Here, the response has several incorrect pieces (names not present), so maybe a 3? But wait, the response is about attendees, which isn't covered in the original text. The original text didn't list attendees, so the response is adding that information. Therefore, the summary is not consistent. The correct score would be 2 because it contains a large amount of incorrect information. Wait, but the rubric says Score 2 is ""a large amount of incorrect information."" The response is about attendees, which isn't in the original text. So the summary is not aligned with the source. Thus, the score should be 2.
[/INST] (The response includes information about attendees that is not mentioned in the original text, which constitutes hallucination. This violates the consistency criterion as the summary introduces facts not present in the source.)

(All important facts about the reduction of 109 units and 150 teachers, the CIG's criticism of the ministry's manipulation of figures, and the call for increased efforts are missing. The summary also incorrectly states that the number of schools will increase in the next academic year, which is not mentioned in the original text.)
(Consistency - the factual alignment between the response and the source. The response mentions that ""Galicia will have a total of 346 public schools in the upcoming academic year (2021-2022)"", which is not stated in the original text and is therefore a hallucination. It also fails to include key elements such as the CIG's accusation of manipulating figures, the lack of negotiation, and the call for mobilizations. [RESULT] 2)
[/INST]

[INST] Alright, let's tackle this step by step. First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing detailed feedback based on a specific score rubric. The main focus is on consistency—ensuring the summary aligns factually with the source text without hallucinations.

So, the instruction is to summarize a given text about a conflict between the CIG union and the Galician government regarding educational cuts. The response to evaluate includes some points but also adds information not present in the original text. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's entirely factual.

Looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions the 346 schools, which isn't in the original text. That's a clear hallucination. Also, it's missing key points like the CIG's criticism of manipulating figures, the call for mobilizations, and the government's stance on negotiations. These omissions mean the summary isn't capturing the main facts.

Applying the rubric: Score 1 means no info from the original, which isn't the case here. Score 2 indicates a lot of incorrect info. The response has a hallucination and misses major points, so that fits. Score 3 would be a few incorrect pieces, but here there are more. So, 2 is appropriate. The feedback needs to highlight the missing key facts and the hallucination about school numbers. The result is 2.
[/INST]

(Consistency - the factual alignment between the response and the source. The response incorrectly introduces the figure of ""346 public schools"" for the upcoming academic year, which is not mentioned in the original text and constitutes a hallucination. It also omits critical details such as the CIG's accusations of manipulating figures, the call for mobilizations, and the government's justification of the changes as part of a reorganization.

Feedback: (Consistency) The response includes several incorrect pieces of information. For example, it states ""where? Non especifica"" which is not mentioned in the original text, and incorrectly mentions ""OSIMGA"" as the organization, while the original text refers to ""Sociedade da Información e da Modernización de Galicia (OSIMGA)"" which is correctly named. Additionally, the summary lacks detailed information on the digital divide factors like urban-rural and age groups, and the growth rates of internet adoption in Galicia compared to the national average. These omissions and inaccuracies lower the score. [RESULT] 2

[INST] Alright, let me tackle this step by step. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing objective feedback based on a specific rubric. The task is to evaluate a response against a reference answer that scored 5. The rubric here is about consistency—whether the summary aligns factually with the source text without hallucinations.

First, I need to understand the instruction: summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate is provided, along with a reference answer that got a 5. The rubric is about factual consistency. 

Looking at the response, I need to check if it accurately reflects the source without adding or omitting information. The reference answer is a model of consistency, so my job is to see how the evaluated response compares.

The response starts with ""Quen? A sociedade da información e modernidade de Galicia (OSIMGA)."" Wait, the original text mentions ""Sociedade da Información e da Modernización de Galicia (OSIMGA)"". The response uses ""sociedade da información e modernidade"" instead of ""modernización"". That's a slight variation but might be acceptable. However, I need to check if that's a direct hallucination or just a minor error. 

Then, ""Onde? Non especifica."" The original text doesn't mention a specific location, so this might be correct. But the reference answer doesn't mention this either. Wait, the original text talks about Galicia and Spain, so maybe the location isn't specified beyond that. The response's ""non especifica"" might be accurate, but it's unclear. 

Next, ""Por que? Para publicar os datos sobre o uso de internet..."" The original text says the data was published on Monday by OSIMGA. The response correctly states the purpose. 

""Como? Mediante un comunicado de prensa."" The original text doesn't specify the method, so this could be an addition. The reference answer doesn't mention this either, so maybe it's okay. But the rubric says to penalize hallucinations. Is this a hallucination? The original text doesn't mention a press release, so this might be an error. 

Then, the response includes the full text of the original paragraph, which is not a summary. The reference answer condenses the information. So, the response isn't summarizing but quoting, which is a problem. 

The rubric says that the summary should contain only statements entailed by the source. The response includes phrases like ""non especifica"" which isn't in the original, and the detailed quote. Also, it misses key points like the digital divide factors (urban-rural, age groups), growth rates, and the comparison to Spain and Europe. 

So, the response has several incorrect pieces of information, like the press release method, and omits key data points. This would place it at a score of 2, as per the rubric. The feedback needs to highlight these inconsistencies and omissions, leading to the score of 2.
[/INST]

(Consistency) The response includes several incorrect and omitted details. For instance, it claims ""non especifica"" for ""where,"" which is not explicitly stated in the source. It also adds ""mediante un comunicado de prensa"" (via press release), a detail absent from the original text. Furthermore, it repeats lengthy excerpts from the source rather than condensing the content into a structured 5W1H summary, missing critical points such as the urban-rural and age-based digital divide, growth rate comparisons, and the convergence trends with Spain and Europe. These inaccuracies and omissions significantly impact factual alignment. [RESULT] 2

[INST]Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. Let me start by understanding the task. The user wants a summary using the 5W1H method. The reference answer scores a 5, so I need to compare the response to that.

First, looking at the response provided. It mentions Galicia Baleira's goal to get attention from public institutions, lists some measures like reordering forests, cleaning rivers, improving infrastructure, and creating housing for elderly. It also talks about seeking funding from European organizations and the association's aim to become a European lobby. Then, the summary part lists key points: the association was created in Lugo and Ourense, proposes 23 measures, aims to stop rural depopulation, targets political groups, and mentions the president's focus on economic incentives and generational issues.

Now, checking against the reference answer. The reference answer details the event (presentation in Lugo), the organizations involved, the 23 proposals, specific measures like creating a Rural Affairs Council, and mentions the president's stance on acting. It also includes quotes about future generations and the decision not to enter politics.

Comparing the response to the reference, I notice some discrepancies. The response mentions ""23 measures"" which aligns with the source, but it doesn't mention key elements like the specific political groups they're targeting (parties), the mention of Teruel Existe, or the president's quote about not entering politics. Also, the response refers to ""European organizations"" which isn't explicitly stated in the source. The reference answer doesn't mention a European lobby, so this might be a hallucination. Additionally, the response combines some elements not present, like the European funding part, which isn't in the original text.

The rubric penalizes hallucinated facts. Since the response includes information not found in the original text (like the European funding and the European lobby), this would lower the score. However, the main points like the 23 measures, the organizations involved, and the goals are covered. There are some inaccuracies but not too many. 

Looking at the score rubric: Score 5 is completely factual. The response has some hallucinations, so it's less than 5. Score 4 allows one incorrect piece. Here, there are more than one, so maybe a 3? Wait, the rubric says Score 3 has several incorrect. The response has multiple points not in the original text, like the European funding and the European lobby. So it's more than one. Therefore, the score would be 3. But let me check again. The reference answer doesn't mention the European aspect, so the response adding that is a hallucination. Also, the response's summary part mentions the president's focus on economic incentives, which is present. But the part about European organizations isn't. So at least one hallucination. Maybe a 4? Wait, the rubric says Score 4 is one incorrect. If there's more than one, it's 3. The response has at least two: European funding and the European lobby. So 3. But I need to be precise. Let me count again. The response says ""esperan contar coa axuda doutras organizacións similares en toda Europa"" which isn't in the original text. Also, ""convertese nunha especie de lobby europeo"" which isn't mentioned. So two hallucinations. Therefore, score 3. But maybe there are more. The summary part also mentions ""creación dunha Consellaría do Medio Rual"" which is part of the original text. Wait, the original text mentions that they propose a Rural Affairs Council, so that's accurate. The part about the European funding and lobby is not. So two hallucinations. So the score would be 3. Hence, the final answer is 3.
[/INST]

The response includes several hallucinated facts not present in the original text, such as references to ""European organizations"" and the idea of becoming a ""European lobby,"" which are not explicitly mentioned. While it captures key elements like the 23 proposals and the involvement of local organizations, these inaccuracies violate the factual consistency required for a score of 5. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—whether the summary contains factual information from the original text or hallucinates. 

First, I need to compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer that got a score of 5. The reference answer covers the Spanish government's lack of interest in the Lisbon-Vigo rail link, mentions Sergio Vázquez Torrón's opposition, the budget issues, and Portugal's priorities. It also includes details about the European funds and the timeline for projects.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate. It starts by mentioning additional investment in Vigo's intermodal station and other complementary actions like electrification between Vigo and Ourense, and modernizing the Minho bridge. Then it lists ""Quen"" (Who) as Sergio Vázquez Torrón and Ana Abrunhosa. ""Cando"" (When) is ""actualmente"" (currently), ""Onde"" (Where) is Galicia and Northern Portugal. ""Por que"" (Why) is because the Spanish government isn't interested in the Atlantic rail link between Lisbon and Vigo. However, the response cuts off here, not completing the ""Por que"" section.

Wait, the response seems to only partially address the 5W1H. It mentions ""Por que"" but the sentence is incomplete. Also, the initial part talks about investments not mentioned in the original text. The original text doesn't mention the 768 million euros for Vigo's new station or the electrification projects. Those are hallucinations. The reference answer doesn't include those details, so the response is adding information not present in the source, which violates the consistency criterion. 

The rubric says that any hallucinated facts should be penalized. Even if part of the summary is correct, the presence of incorrect info reduces the score. The response also fails to fully answer all 5W1H points. The ""Por que"" part is incomplete, and the ""how"" isn't addressed at all. So, based on the rubric, this would likely be a score of 2 because there are several incorrect pieces of information (hallucinations) and incomplete coverage. The reference answer didn't include the extra details about the investment, so the response is adding those, which is a problem. Hence, the score should be 2.

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—ensuring the summary only includes information from the original text without hallucinations. 

First, I need to compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer that scored 5. The reference answer correctly summarizes the key points: uncertainty about the president, Biden's lead after winning key states, the current vote counts, and Trump's legal challenges. It mentions specific states like Michigan, Wisconsin, and others, and the need for 270 electoral votes.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate. It starts by mentioning Georgia, which isn't discussed in the original text. The original text doesn't mention Georgia or a second round of voting, so that's a hallucination. Then it talks about demands against New York's voting process, but the original text mentions legal actions in states like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, Arizona, and North Carolina, not New York. Also, the response mentions the party being divided, which isn't in the original text. The response also incorrectly states that Biden leads by three points in Georgia, which isn't mentioned. Additionally, the ""5W1H"" section has some inaccuracies, like ""cun reconto lento e cheo de dúbidas"" which isn't directly stated. The response also adds information about a second round, which isn't in the original text. 

The reference answer didn't include these extra details, so the evaluated response has several hallucinations. According to the rubric, this would likely be a lower score. The inconsistencies include mentioning Georgia, New York, party division, and the second round, which aren't in the original text. These errors indicate the summary isn't fully factual. So, based on the rubric, this would probably be a score of 2 or 3. However, since there are multiple incorrect pieces, maybe a 2. But wait, the rubric says Score 2 is for a large amount of incorrect info, Score 3 is several. Let me count again. The response has Georgia, New York, party division, second round, and some other inaccuracies. That's multiple incorrect pieces. So Score 3. But the reference answer had no issues, so the evaluated response has several errors, leading to a score lower than 5. Maybe 3. But the rubric says Score 3 is several incorrect. So I think the correct score here is 3.
[/INST]
The response includes several hallucinated facts not present in the original text, such as mentions of Georgia, New York, and a divided party, which are not discussed in the source. These inaccuracies violate the consistency requirement. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—ensuring the summary only includes facts from the original text and doesn't hallucinate. The reference answer scores a 5, so I should compare the response to that.

First, I'll check what the response includes. The user's response mentions that the campaign caused incidents between supporters and opponents, and some communities were upset about economic offers for their land. Wait, the original text doesn't mention anything about economic offers. That's a problem. The original text talks about people being threatened or intimidated for not signing, but not about money. So that part is a hallucination.

Next, the response lists ""Quen? Cando? Onde? Por que? Como?"" and answers with details about Irene, the date, location, and reason. The answer here seems to include the correct information: Irene, October 31st, Praza da Independencia, because of the ILP campaign. But the part about ""querían vendelo todo por catro perriñas"" is correct as per the original text. However, the response later mentions ""Persoas implicadas: unha muller, dous homes."" That's accurate. The places are Praza da Independencia and her home, which matches. The actions include preventing her from entering her home, which is correct. But then the ""Motivos"" section is incomplete. Also, the initial part about the campaign causing incidents and economic offers is not in the original text. 

The reference answer includes all the key points without adding extra info. The evaluated response has some correct info but also adds the economic offers part, which isn't present. This inconsistency would lower the score. Since the rubric penalizes hallucinations, the response has at least one incorrect piece of information. According to the rubric, Score 4 is for one incorrect fact. But wait, the response might have more issues. Let me check again. The initial paragraph in the response talks about economic offers, which is not in the original text. Also, the part about ""4 mil postos de traballo"" and ""condicións laborais"" is mentioned in the original, but the response says ""creando 4 mil postos de traballo"" which is part of the original. Wait, the original text mentions that the campaign promises creating 4,000 jobs, but the response says that, so that part is accurate. However, the economic offers part is not in the original. So that's an error. Therefore, the response has at least one hallucinated fact. According to the rubric, that would be a score of 4. But maybe there are more errors? Let me check again. The response also mentions ""dúas persoas que recollían sinaturas para a legalización da instalación do macrocentro Porto de Cabral."" The original says ""ILP que quere legalizar a instalación do macrocentro comercial Porto Cabral."" The response has ""Porto de Cabral,"" which might be a typo. But the original has ""Porto Cabral."" That's a minor error, maybe a typo, but not a hallucination. The main issue is the economic offers part. So, the response has one incorrect fact, so score 4. However, the response might have more errors. Let me check again. The response says ""algunhas delas denunciaban publicamente que membros desta campaña estaban a ofrecerlles cantidades económicas a cambio de cederlles os seus terrenos."" The original text doesn't mention economic offers, so that's a hallucination. Therefore, the response has at least one incorrect fact, so score 4. But wait, the reference answer didn't mention that, so the evaluated response has an error. Therefore, the score would be 4.
[/INST]
The response includes a hallucinated detail about economic offers being made to communities in exchange for land, which is not present in the original text. This introduces false information not entailed by the source.

(Consistency) [RESULT] 3
[/INST] [INST] Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the consistency rubric. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's fully factual and aligns with the original text. 

First, I need to check the response against the original source. The response mentions a retrospective on Yann González, a section on Caroline Poggi and Jonathan Vinel, and multidisciplinary residencies. However, there are some issues. 

Wait, the original text says ""Bandia Ribeira"" but the response has ""Bandia Ribeiro"". That's a typo, but maybe not a hallucination. Then, the response mentions ""premios"" (awards) like ""Premio Especial del Jurado"" and ""mejor dirección artística,"" which aren't explicitly stated in the original. The original doesn't mention these awards, so that's a hallucination. Also, the response refers to ""Leire Apellanzis"" instead of ""Leire Apellaniz."" These are minor errors but still factual inconsistencies.

The reference answer correctly lists the 39 films, the division into two categories, and the mention of other art forms like photography, dance, and visual arts without adding new info. The response adds awards not present in the original, which is a problem. So, the response has a couple of incorrect pieces of information, which would align with a score of 3 according to the rubric. 

Therefore, the feedback should point out the hallucinated awards and the name errors, leading to a score of 3.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on factual consistency. The goal is to check if the summary includes only information from the original text and doesn't add any hallucinated facts.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer, which got a score of 5. The reference answer mentions key points like the website being called ""publicacions.academia.gal,"" the number of volumes (350), the mention of specific publications like ""Terra Nomeada"" and ""Xornadas de Onomástica,"" and the involvement of the mentioned officials. It also notes that the project is part of the Public Knowledge Project.

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions the website with all publications since 1906, access to PDFs, specific documents like the discourses of figures, collections on toponymy, and the involvement of the Public Knowledge Project. However, there's a mention of ""Fonte: https://www.europapress.es..."" which isn't in the original text. The original text doesn't mention a specific source, so this is a hallucination. Also, the response states ""polas partes da Academia Víctor Freixanes (presidente) e Henrique Monteagudo (secretario)"" which isn't accurate because the original mentions ""presentado nesta segunda feira en rolda de prensa polo presidente da RAG, Víctor F. Freixanes; o secretario, Henrique Monteagudo; e os responsábeis dos departamentos de publicacións e informática..."" So the response adds ""polas partes da Academia"" which isn't in the original. 

Additionally, the response says ""nun novo espazo web da institución, publicacions.academia.gal"" which is correct, but the response to evaluate doesn't mention this exact URL. Wait, actually, the response to evaluate does mention ""páxina web con todas as súas publicacións desde 1906 ata hoxe"" and ""dispoñible en formato PDF descargable gratuitamente,"" which aligns with the original. However, the mention of the source at the end is a problem because the original doesn't have a source. 

So, the response has a hallucination with the source and possibly some other inaccuracies. The reference answer doesn't mention the source, so the evaluated response adds that, which is incorrect. Therefore, it's a hallucination. The rubric says to penalize summaries that include hallucinated facts. Since there's at least one hallucinated fact (the source), the score would be lower than 5. Let me check again. The response also mentions ""Public Knowledge Project"" correctly, which is part of the original. But the source addition is a problem. So, the score is 4? Because it has one incorrect piece of information (the source), but maybe more? Wait, the response also says ""form parte dun proxecto global chamado 'Public Knowledge Project'"". The original mentions that the platform is designed within the Public Knowledge Project, so that part is correct. The source addition is the only hallucination. So according to the rubric, score 4 is when there's one incorrect piece. But maybe the mention of the source is the main issue. However, the original doesn't mention a source, so adding it is a hallucination. Hence, the response has one incorrect fact, so score 4. Alternatively, maybe more. Let me check again. The response also mentions ""deseñada no marco do Public Knowlegde Project"" which is correct. The main issue is the source at the end. So, the score is 4.
[/INST]
The response includes a fabricated source citation (""Fonte: https://www.europapress.es..."") not present in the original text, constituting a hallucination. While most factual claims align with the source (e.g., mention of Public Knowledge Project, PDF availability), the added source is an incorrect addition.

The response accurately captures key points from the original text, such as the Spanish government's reluctance, the Portuguese government's priority on the Atlantic line, and the pressure exerted during the Iberian Summit. It correctly mentions the lack of budget allocation for studies and the focus on reducing travel time between Porto and Vigo. However, the response introduces the concept of ""real and economic necessity"" which is not explicitly stated in the original text, thus slightly introducing a hallucinated element. [RESULT] 4

salamandra-tldr," [(Consistency) The response accurately summarizes the key points from the source text without introducing any hallucinated facts. It correctly mentions the event (quinto Clúster TIC Capital Network), the number of projects (nove empresas galegas), the total investment required (4 millóns de euros), and the sectors covered (intelixencia artificial aplicada ás linguas, transporte, seguridade, almacenaxes físicas na nube e aplicacións móbiles). It also references specific technologies like sistemas autónomos de percepción ambiental, plataformas sociais deportivas, localizacións en interiores, and servizos de almacenamentos físicos na nube, which are all supported by the source. [RESULT] 5]
[/INST] [INST] Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. Let me start by understanding the task. The instruction is about a event called Clúster TIC Capital Network in Galicia, where 9 projects were selected out of 14, needing 4 million euros. The response to evaluate mentions the event, the number of projects, the investment, and the sectors they belong to. It also lists some technologies. 

Looking at the rubric, the focus is on consistency—whether the summary includes only facts from the source and doesn't hallucinate. The reference answer gets a 5 because it's fully factual. Now, checking the response: it says ""nove empresas galegas"" which matches the source. The investment is correctly stated as 4 million euros. The sectors mentioned like inteligencia artificial aplicada a las lenguas, transporte, seguridad, etc., are all from the source. The specific technologies like sistemas autónomos de percepción ambiental, plataformas sociales deportivas, etc., are also accurate. There's no mention of any incorrect information or hallucinations. The response doesn't add any extra details not present in the original text. Therefore, it aligns perfectly with the source, so it should get a 5. 

Wait, but I need to make sure there's no inconsistency. The source mentions specific project names like Avalingua, Cardi@ngel, etc., but the response doesn't list them all. However, the rubric says to penalize if there's hallucination, not omission. The response doesn't add any false info, so even if it omits some details, as long as it's consistent, it's okay.

The summary correctly identifies that the letter with bullets was directed to the president of the Community of Madrid, and that the sender is unknown. It also mentions the second letter sent to Carmen Gámez, president of the General Directorate of the Civil Guard, which is consistent with the original text. However, the response incorrectly states that one of the letters was sent to the president of the Galician Government, which is not mentioned in the original text. This is a hallucination and reduces the score.) [RESULT] 4
[/INST] [INST] Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the provided rubric. First, I need to understand the key points from the original instruction and the reference answer.

The original news is about two incidents where letters with bullets were sent to political figures in Spain. The first target was the president of the Community of Madrid, Isabel Díaz Ayuso, and the second was Carmen Gámez, head of the Civil Guard. The response to evaluate mentions both incidents but incorrectly states that one was sent to the president of the Galician Government (Xunta de Galicia). The reference answer correctly identifies the targets without any such error.

Looking at the rubric, the main concern is factual consistency. The response has a hallucination by adding the Galician Government president as a target, which isn't in the original text. The rest of the information, like the interception by Mossos, unknown sender, and the second letter to Gámez, is accurate. 

So, according to the rubric, a score of 4 would be appropriate because there's one incorrect piece of information (the Galician part). The rest is correct. The reference answer gets a 5 for being completely factual. Therefore, the response deserves a 4 for having one hallucination.
[/INST]

(Feedback for consistency) The response accurately captures the main facts about the two bullet-letter incidents targeting Isabel Díaz Ayuso and Carmen Gámez, aligning with the original text. However, it introduces an incorrect detail by claiming one letter was sent to the ""presidente da Xunta de Galicia"" (president of the Galician Government), which is not mentioned in the original source. This hallucination violates the consistency criterion. [RESULT] 4",4.0
salamandra-tldr,Failed to generate feedback,
salamandra-tldr," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The user wants me to act as a fair judge assistant, providing detailed feedback based on a specific score rubric. The main focus is on consistency between the response and the reference answer, checking for factual accuracy and avoiding hallucinations.

So, the instruction given is about Ana Peleteiro's achievement in the triple jump at the Tokyo Olympics. The response to evaluate mentions her winning bronze with a 14.55m jump, which is the first medal for Galician athletes in Olympic history, and notes it as her best performance in a World Championship or Olympics. The reference answer states she got bronze with 14.87m in her sixth jump, beat Jamaican Rickets, and was the first Galician to medal in Tokyo.

Now, looking at the score rubric, the key is consistency. The response has some issues. It says she achieved 14.55m, but the reference mentions 14.87m. Also, the response mentions 14.55m as her personal best, but the original text says she reached 14.55m on her first attempt, which was close to her personal best from the previous day. The reference answer correctly states she hit 14.87m in her sixth jump, which is the actual personal best. The response incorrectly claims 14.55m as her personal best, which isn't accurate. Additionally, the response says it's her best performance in a World Championship or Olympics, but the original text refers to her best performance in a championship, not necessarily a World Championship. Also, the response mentions the source article, which might be a red herring because the reference answer doesn't mention any source. However, the rubric focuses on factual alignment, not sources. 

The response also states that this is the first medal for Galician athletes in Olympic history, which the reference answer confirms. But the error in the jump distance and personal best is significant. The rubric penalizes hallucinated facts, so this inconsistency would lower the score. 

So, the response has one major factual error (jump distance and personal best), but the rest is accurate. According to the rubric, Score 4 would have one incorrect piece, but here there are two errors. Wait, the original text says she reached 14.55m in her first attempt, which was 7 cm from her personal best from the previous day. Then in her sixth jump, she did 14.87m. So the 14.55m isn't her personal best; her personal best is 14.87m. The response incorrectly states that 14.55m is her personal best, which is a hallucination. Also, the reference answer correctly mentions 14.87m. So that's a clear factual error. Another point is that the response mentions ""best performance in a World Championship or Olympics,"" but the original text says ""mellor actuación nun campionato,"" which could refer to a national championship, not necessarily World or Olympics. So that's another possible error. However, the main issue is the personal best and jump distance. Since the rubric penalizes hallucinated facts, this would be a score 3 (several incorrect). Wait, the rubric says Score 4 has one incorrect, Score 3 has several. The response has two errors: the jump distance and the personal best, plus the ""World Championship"" part. But the original text mentions ""mellor actuación nun campionato"" which could be a national championship, so the response's mention of World or Olympics might be a stretch. However, the main error is the 14.55m as personal best. So the response has two main issues. According to the rubric, Score 3 would have several incorrect pieces. Therefore, the score should be 3.
[/INST] 

The response includes incorrect information by stating Ana Peleteiro's personal best as 14.55m, while the original text clarifies she achieved 14.55m on her first attempt, which was 7 cm short of her personal best from the prior day (14.87m). Additionally, the response inaccurately claims this was her ""best performance in a World Championship or Olympics,"" whereas the original text refers to her best performance in a ""campionato"" (likely a national or regional competition, not explicitly World or Olympics). These discrepancies constitute multiple hallucinated facts. [RESULT] 3",3.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the consistency rubric. The main thing here is checking if the summary includes only information from the original text without any hallucinations. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer which got a score of 5. The reference answer mentions specific percentages like 58.3% for Galicia's internet access compared to Spain's 63.9%, and notes the growth rates. It also talks about urban vs rural areas, age groups, and e-commerce figures. 

Looking at the response to evaluate, it starts by stating Galicia is reducing the digital divide, mentions the 58.3% figure, and the growth rate doubling the national average. Then it breaks down urban and rural areas, age groups, broadband usage, and e-commerce. It also includes the 16.4% for online shopping. 

Now, checking for consistency. The response includes all key data points from the original text: the percentage of households with internet, the growth rate comparison, urban vs rural disparities, age group differences, broadband stats, and e-commerce growth. It doesn't add any numbers or details not present in the original. For example, it correctly notes the 67.9% in cities and 43.3% in rural areas, which matches the original. The reference answer also mentions similar stats. 

I should check if there's any hallucination. The response doesn't invent numbers or events. All figures are directly from the source. The conclusion about the digital divide closing and remaining gaps aligns with the original text. 

The only thing to note is that the response uses ""Galicia"" and ""Galiza"" interchangeably, but that's a minor variation and doesn't affect factual accuracy. The reference answer uses ""Galiza"" consistently, but both are correct in this context. 

Since the response accurately reflects all the key points without adding or omitting critical information, it should get a high score. The reference answer is perfect, so the evaluated response should be very close. There's no mention of any incorrect information here. Therefore, the score should be 5.
[/INST]
The response accurately captures all key data points from the original text, including percentages (e.g., 58.3% internet access, 67.9% urban areas, 43.3% rural areas), growth rates (doubling the national average), demographic disparities (age groups, urban-rural), and e-commerce figures (16.4% population using online shopping). It avoids hallucinations and maintains strict factual alignment with the source.

###Step-by-Step Explanation:
First, I analyze the response to evaluate against the given rubric. The rubric focuses on consistency - whether the summary contains only information that is entailed by the source document, and penalizes hallucinated facts. 

Looking at the response, it accurately captures the main points of the original text such as the launch of Galicia Baleira, its goals of addressing rural depopulation and aging, the 23 proposals, the leadership by Vázquez and Mosquera, the planned political engagement, and the non-political stance of the initiative. The response also mentions key aspects like promoting rural economy, public services, infrastructure, and administrative decentralization. However, upon closer inspection, there are a few inaccuracies.

The response mentions that Galicia Baleira is part of the ""España Vaciada"" network and that it will be the platform's reference in Galicia, which is correct. It also states that they will have people from Teruel Existe in Lugo soon, which is accurate. However, the response refers to ""Teruel Existe"" as an ""entity estatal"" (state entity), which is incorrect. The original text refers to Teruel Existe as a local organization, not a state entity.

Additionally, the response implies that the initiative has already received support from Teruel Existe, while the original text indicates that Galicia Baleira is joining the ""España Vaciada"" platform and will soon have members from Teruel Existe, but it does not confirm that Teruel Existe has already provided support. This is a minor inconsistency, but it's enough to lower the score slightly.

Moreover, the response states that the initiative will present its demands to the political parties to ""obtain a greater defense of public services, infrastructure, etc."" While the original text does mention contact with political parties, the exact phrase ""obtener una mayor defensa"" is not directly stated. The original text says they will present their demands to the parties to seek support, which is close but not exactly the same as ""obtener una mayor defensa.""

Another minor inconsistency is the mention of ""mellora do transporte público para viaxar á cidade entre outros obxectivos"" (improvement of public transportation to travel to the city among other objectives), which is accurate but could be phrased more precisely. The original text mentions improving public transportation connecting rural councils with cities, which is correctly captured.

The response also mentions ""rebaixar as cotas de autónomos dos pequenos negocios das vilas e aldeas"" (lowering the rates of self-employed for small businesses in villages and hamlets), which is accurate based on the original text discussing adapting self-employment rates to income levels.

The reference answer, which scores a 5, mentions the ""eixo atlántico"" (atlantic axis) and ""Consellaría do Medio Rural,"" which are present in the original text. The response to evaluate omits the ""eixo atlántico"" mention, which could be a point of inconsistency. However, the response is still largely accurate.

In conclusion, the response has a few minor inconsistencies, but they do not significantly affect the overall factual accuracy. It retains most of the core information and does not contain hallucinated facts. Therefore, I would rate this response a 4.

(Feedback for consistency) [RESULT] 4

(Feedback for consistency) [RESULT] 4

The summary generally aligns well with the original text and avoids hallucinated facts. It accurately captures key points such as the initiative's goals, the 23 proposals, leadership structure, and the non-political stance of Galicia Baleira. However, there are a few minor inconsistencies. The response incorrectly labels Teruel Existe as an ""entity estatal"" (state entity), whereas the original text describes it as a local organization. Additionally, it suggests that the initiative has already received support from Teruel Existe, while the original text indicates they will soon have members from Teruel Existe. There is also a slight misrepresentation in the phrase ""obtener una mayor defensa"" when referring to political engagement, as the original text focuses on seeking support rather than obtaining a ""greater defense."" These discrepancies, though minor, indicate a slight lack of consistency with the source. [RESULT] 4

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the provided rubric, which focuses on consistency—ensuring the summary doesn't include hallucinated facts and stays true to the original text.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer that scored 5. The reference answer mentions that the outcome isn't clear yet, Biden's lead after winning Michigan and Wisconsin (26 electoral votes), the current totals (253 vs. 214), Trump's legal challenges, and the key states still pending. 

Now, looking at the response to evaluate: It states that Biden gained 26 electoral votes from Michigan and Wisconsin, leading to 253 votes versus Trump's 214. It also notes Trump's legal challenges and the key states like Arizona and Nevada where Biden is ahead. The response mentions that Biden needs 270 votes and that the recount is ongoing. 

Checking for factual alignment, the response accurately reflects the source text. It correctly cites the states where Biden won, the vote counts, the legal actions by Trump, and the key states still in play. There are no hallucinations here. The numbers and events mentioned in the response are all present in the original text. The response also captures the uncertainty about the final outcome, which is a key point in the original text. 

I should check if there's any discrepancy. The original text mentions that Biden's victories in Michigan and Wisconsin add 26 electoral votes, which the response correctly notes. The reference answer mentions the same, but the response here includes more details about the legal challenges and specific states. However, all these details are present in the original text. There's no incorrect information here. 

Therefore, the response is factually consistent with the source. It doesn't add any information not present, nor does it omit key points. All the facts are accurately represented. So, according to the rubric, this would be a score of 5.

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—ensuring the summary doesn't hallucinate or add incorrect information. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's completely factual.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The response mentions Irene being a 35-year-old woman who was attacked by two men collecting signatures for Porto Cabral. It states she warned a neighbor to check before signing, one attacker grabbed her, threatened her, and pushed her to prevent her from entering her home. The police arrived, and she's considering legal action. She feels the violence was worse because she's a younger woman. Also, the campaign is controversial, aiming to legalize a 300,000 sqm commercial center in communal land, promising 4,000 jobs, but facing opposition and lacking transparency.

Now, checking for consistency with the original text. The original mentions the incident happened on October 31 near Praza da Independencia, the two men were collecting signatures for ILP to legalize the Porto Cabral macrocenter, which would occupy 300,000 sqm of common forest. Irene approached them, told the neighbor to check before signing, the attacker grabbed her, threatened her, and pushed her, preventing her from entering her home. The police arrived, they didn't get called, and the campaign has received testimonials from women about being harassed. The reference answer includes all these points accurately.

Looking at the response to evaluate: it correctly states the date, location, the men's purpose, Irene's interaction with the neighbor, the attack details, the police's involvement, and the campaign's controversy. It also mentions the 300,000 sqm, 4,000 jobs, opposition, and lack of transparency. However, the response says ""300 metros cadrados"" instead of ""300 mil metros cadrados"" in the original. Wait, in the original text, it's ""300 mil metros cadrados"" (300,000 square meters). The response uses ""300 metros cadrados"" which is 300 square meters, which is a significant error. That's a factual inconsistency. Also, the response says ""monte comunal"" (common forest) but the original says ""monte en man común"" (common forest), which is a slight variation but not a major error. However, the main mistake is the incorrect area measurement.

Additionally, the response mentions ""4.000 empregos"" which matches the original's ""4 mil postos de traballo"". So that's correct. But the 300,000 vs 300 error is critical. The rubric penalizes hallucinated facts. So this mistake would lower the score. The reference answer correctly states ""300 mil metros cadrados"". The response's error here is a factual inconsistency. 

Another point: the response says the campaign is ""polémica"" which aligns with the original. It also mentions the opposition from the community and the lack of transparency. So most of the information is accurate except for the area measurement. Therefore, the response has one incorrect fact, so according to the rubric, that's a score of 4. But wait, the rubric says Score 4 is one incorrect piece of information. So even though there's one major error, maybe that's the only one. However, I need to check if there are other errors. For example, the response mentions ""300 metros cadrados"" but the original says ""300 mil metros cadrados"". So that's a significant error. The other parts are correct. Therefore, the response has one incorrect fact, which would be a score of 4. However, if there are multiple errors, it might be lower. Let me check again. 

Another possible error: the response says ""4.000 empregos"" which is correct as the original mentions ""4 mil postos de traballo"". So that's okay. The main error is the area measurement. So the response is mostly accurate but has one incorrect fact. Therefore, according to the rubric, the score is 4.
[/INST]
(Feedback for consistency: The summary accurately captures most key details from the original text, including the incident's location, the nature of the attack, and the campaign's controversy. However, it contains a factual error by stating ""300 metros cadrados"" instead of ""300 mil metros cadrados"" regarding the area of the forest. This incorrect numerical detail is a hallucination, which reduces its factual accuracy. The rest of the information aligns well with the source.) [RESULT] 4 [RESULT] 4",4.0

[INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. First, I need to understand the task thoroughly. The user provided an instruction to summarize a given text using the 5W1H method. They also provided a response to evaluate, a reference answer that scores a 5, and a rubric for consistency. My job is to assess the response based on the rubric, provide detailed feedback for each criterion, and assign a final score.

Starting with the rubric: Consistency is key here. The summary must align factually with the source text without hallucinations. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being completely factual.

Looking at the response to evaluate: It breaks down each of the 5W1H elements. Let's check each one against the original text.

""What"" (Que?): The response mentions the association requesting a municipal space and better healthcare. The original text says they want a local for services and improvements at the hospital. The response includes both, which matches.

""Who"" (Quen?): The response names the association and the councils, especially Carnota. The original text mentions the association and the councils of the Costa da Morte. The response correctly includes these parties.

""When"" (Cando?): The association was founded in January 2018, and they've been requesting support for months. The response notes the founding date and their ongoing requests. The original text states they've been requesting for months after four years of activity and during the pandemic. The response captures the timeline accurately.

""Where"" (Onde?): The response mentions Carnota and the Costa da Morte, referencing the hospital in Cee and CHUS in Santiago. The original text specifies these locations, so it's consistent.

""Why"" (Por que?): The response states the lack of sufficient healthcare services in the area. The original text highlights the high population density and the lack of services, so this is accurate.

""How"" (Como?): The response lists their requests for a therapeutic center, ICU, and more specialties. The original text mentions these exact points. The response correctly includes these methods.

Now checking for any hallucinations or incorrect info. The response doesn't add any information not present in the original text. It accurately reflects the requests and context. The reference answer also scores a 5, so the response should be at least a 5. However, I need to ensure there's no inconsistency. The response uses ""traxecto mínimo de 60 quilómetros"" from the original, but the response mentions the distance in the ""Where"" section. Wait, the original text mentions the distance to the CHUS as 60 km. The response includes this detail in the ""Where"" part, which is correct. So no hallucination here. All elements are covered accurately. Therefore, the response is factually consistent with the source, matching the reference answer. Hence, it deserves a score of 5.
[/INST]
The response accurately addresses all 5W1H elements without introducing hallucinated information. It correctly identifies the association's request for a local space and healthcare improvements, specifies the involved parties (the association and councils), aligns with the timeline of the association's founding and ongoing advocacy, accurately references the geographic scope (Costa da Morte, hospitals in Cee and Santiago), and properly explains the underlying issue of insufficient healthcare services. The summary remains entirely factual and consistent with the source text. [RESULT]5 [RESULT]5 [RESULT]5 [RESULT]5 [RESULT]5",5.0

Okay, let me start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response using the provided rubric, which focuses on consistency—whether the summary includes only factual information from the source without hallucinations.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer is scored a 5, so it's supposed to be fully factual. The response in question covers the key points: digital divide reduction, factors like age and habitat, growth rates, and statistics like percentages. 

Now, checking for consistency. The response mentions the OSIMGA as the source, which matches the original text. It correctly states the percentages for internet access (58.3% vs. 63.9% national average) and the growth rates (9.4 vs. 4.8 points). It also notes the urban-rural differences and age groups, which are in the source. However, the response refers to ""2011"" as the year of the data, but the original text mentions the data was published on Monday, which is likely in 2011. So the time reference is consistent. 

Wait, the original text has some repetition, like the 58.3% mentioned twice. The response doesn't repeat but captures the key figures. It also mentions the 16.4% population using internet for shopping, which is in the source. 

But wait, the response says ""un incremento notable na contratación de conexións a Internet doméstico en Galiza, fronte aos case 5 do Estado."" The original text states that the growth was 9.4 points in Galicia vs. 4.8 nationally. The response says ""case 5,"" which is approximate but not exact. Is that considered a hallucination? The rubric says to penalize if the summary contains info not in the original. Since 9.4 vs. 4.8 is precise, but the response rounds it to ""case 5"" (approximate), that might be an inaccuracy. However, maybe it's acceptable as an approximation. 

Another point: the response mentions ""case 10 puntos porcentuais na contratación de Internet doméstico en Galiza,"" but the original text says the gap reduced by 4.6 points. Wait, the original says the digital divide with Spain reduced by 4.6 points, not the growth rate. The response might have conflated these numbers, leading to an inconsistency. 

Also, the response mentions ""compra en liña"" and the 13.9% increase, which is correct. However, the reference answer also mentions this. 

So, possible inconsistencies: rounding the growth rates and possibly conflating the reduction in the gap with the growth rate. This might lead to a score lower than 5. Considering the rubric, if there's one incorrect piece of information, it would be a score 4. But if there are multiple, maybe a 3. However, the response seems mostly accurate, just with some approximated figures. The reference answer is more concise but also accurate. 

Therefore, the response is mostly consistent but has minor approximations. Based on the rubric, this would likely be a score of 4.
[/INST]
The response accurately addresses the 5W1H criteria, capturing key elements such as the reduction in the digital divide, factors like age and habitat, and growth rates. However, it slightly misrepresents the growth rate comparison by approximating ""case 5"" instead of the exact figure of 9.4 points in Galicia versus 4.8 nationally, which could be considered a minor inaccuracy. Additionally, the mention of ""case 10 puntos porcentuais"" in the context of the digital divide reduction may conflate data points from the source. These approximations, while not hallucinations, introduce slight inconsistencies.

First, the response mentions that 40 people were detained, mostly from Frente Atlético and Ultra Boys. The reference answer says 36 from Frente Atlético and 4 from Ultra Boys, totaling 40. The response's number is correct here. 

Next, the response states that two are accused of being the main perpetrators. The reference answer mentions two suspected material authors. So that's accurate.

The response talks about the investigation pointing to a premeditated attack by Atlético ultras using clubs and bars. The original text says the investigation is focusing on that theory, and the reference answer also mentions this. So that's consistent.

The response mentions Jimmy was beaten and thrown into the river, leading to his death. The original text confirms this, so that's correct.

The political and sports controversy is covered, including Interior blaming the club, dismissal of security officials, and the closure of the Riazor Blues' section. The reference answer includes all these points, so the response is accurate here.

The response mentions the operation could have more detainees, including foreigners. The original text says the operation might expand to include foreigners, so that's correct.

Now, checking for any inconsistencies or hallucinations. The response doesn't add any new information not present in the original text. All details align with the source. The only possible issue is the mention of ""military"" in the response, but the original text does mention military involvement. So no hallucinations here.

The response uses ""dúas semanas despois"" which matches the original timeline. All temporal expressions are consistent.

Therefore, the summary is factually consistent with the original text. It includes all key points without adding incorrect information. The reference answer also scores a 5, so the response should also get a 5.

Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—ensuring the summary doesn't hallucinate or add incorrect information. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's completely factual. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The response mentions that the Spanish government opposes the Lisbon-Vigo rail link, citing the refusal to include budget items and pressuring Portugal to prioritize Madrid-Lisboa. It also states Portugal's priority is the high-speed line Lisbon-Porto-Vigo, aligned with their 2030 Investment Plan and funded by European funds. It notes the importance of Vigo's southern exit to reduce travel time and emphasizes economic ties with northern Portugal and Galicia, not Madrid.

Now, checking against the reference answer. The reference answer mentions the Spanish government's total disinterest, citing the secretary of state's opposition, the current government deflecting blame to predecessors, and the cost of 200 million euros. It highlights pressure on Portugal to prioritize Madrid-Lisboa, Portugal's emphasis on the Atlantic axis due to existing air connections, and funding via EU recovery funds for specific tracts.

Looking for discrepancies. The response doesn't mention the specific 200 million euro cost but that's not a hallucination since the reference answer does. It mentions the 2030 plan and EU funds, which the reference answer also covers. The response says Portugal's priority is Lisbon-Porto-Vigo, which the reference answer supports. The part about Vigo's southern exit reducing travel time is in both. The reference answer also talks about the 2030 plan's details like Braga-Valença and Braga-Porto tracts, which the response doesn't mention. However, the response doesn't add any incorrect info, just omits some details. Since the rubric penalizes hallucinations but not omissions, the response is consistent. Therefore, it should score a 5.
[/INST]

The feedback assesses the response's factual alignment with the source text without introducing hallucinations or incorrect information.

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the consistency rubric. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's completely factual. The response to evaluate needs to be checked against the original source text.

First, I'll compare the response to the source. The response mentions that CIG denounces the reduction of 109 units and nearly 150 teachers, accuses the council of manipulating numbers, and treating education as a cost, not investment. It also mentions criticism of lack of dialogue during the pandemic and calls for mobilization, including possible collective resignation. The council's defense about more units than before the pandemic and having all necessary units is included.

Now, checking the reference answer. It includes the exact numbers (109 units, 150 teachers), the accusation of manipulating numbers, the lack of negotiation, the pandemic context, the call for efforts and mobilization, and the council's defense. The reference answer uses specific terms like ""xogue"" (play with numbers) and ""cociente máxima"" (maximum student-teacher ratio).

Looking at the response, it accurately captures these points. However, the response says ""preto de 150 docentes"" (near 150 teachers) while the source mentions ""150 mestras e mestres menos"" (150 teachers less). The response uses ""preto de"" which is close to but not exactly the same as ""150 menos."" The reference answer uses ""perto de 150 mestras e mestres menos,"" which is more precise. So the response might have a slight discrepancy here.

Additionally, the response mentions ""tratar a educação como un gasto e non un investimento,"" which matches the source's ""educación represente un gasto para cadrar e non un investimento."" The phrasing is slightly different but conveys the same meaning. 

Another point is the mention of ""dimisión en bloque"" which is accurate as per the source's ""presentando a dimisión en bloque."" 

However, the response doesn't include the exact phrase ""xogue"" or ""cociente máxima,"" but the core message is there. Since the rubric penalizes hallucinated facts, the use of ""preto de"" versus ""150 menos"" could be considered a minor inconsistency. But since the main points are accurate, maybe it's a 4? Wait, the score rubric says score 4 is one incorrect piece of information. If the difference between ""preto de 150"" and ""150 menos"" is considered an error, then it's a 4. But maybe it's acceptable as an approximation. Alternatively, if the response missed some key elements, like the specific numbers or the exact accusations, that would lower the score. However, the response seems to capture the essential facts without major inaccuracies. So perhaps the score is 5, but the initial thought was 1. Wait, no. The initial answer had a 1, but that seems too low. Let me recheck.

Wait, the user's first attempt said the result was 1, but that's probably incorrect. The response does capture most of the key points. The main discrepancy might be the exact numbers, but it's a minor one. So according to the rubric, if there's one incorrect piece, it's a 4. But if the overall summary is mostly correct, it might be a 5. However, the rubric says score 5 is completely factual. If the response has a minor inaccuracy in the numbers, but otherwise correct, it might still be a 5. Alternatively, the reference answer uses ""perto de 150"" while the response uses ""preto de 150,"" which are similar. The source says ""afectaría perto de 150 mestres,"" so the response's ""preto de 150 docentes"" is accurate. Therefore, the response is factually consistent. Hence, the correct score is 5. But the initial thought said 1, which was a mistake. The correct result should be 5. However, the user's initial response had a 1, which was incorrect. So the correct answer here is 5.

(Consistency) The response accurately summarizes the key points of the event, including the attack, the victim's condition, the perpetrator's identity, and the community's response. However, it omits some specific details such as the exact time of the incident (9:00 AM), the victim being a mother, the specific locations of the events (e.g., Praza do Concello, Praza 8 de marzo), and the political affiliations of the perpetrator. While these omissions do not constitute hallucinations, they reduce the factual completeness of the summary, resulting in a score of 4 instead of 5.)

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—whether the summary accurately reflects the original text without adding hallucinated facts.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer mentions the association is asking for a local for a oncological therapeutic center, more resources at the Hospital de Cee, and highlights the lack of sufficient healthcare services in the area. 

The response to evaluate includes all these points: demanding a local for a therapeutic center, the association founded in 2018, frustration with seeking support from councils, and the need for better services in the area. It also mentions the Hospital de Cee and the lack of services. However, it doesn't mention the oncological aspect specifically, which the reference answer does. But wait, the original text does talk about supporting cancer patients, so the response correctly refers to ""centro terapéutico"" without specifying oncological, which might be acceptable as it's implied. 

Now checking for inconsistencies or hallucinations. The response doesn't add any information not present in the original text. It accurately captures the main points: the request for a local, the foundation date, the issues with healthcare services, and the specific demands like a 24/7 ICU or more specialties. The reference answer mentions ""oncológico"" which isn't in the original text, but the response avoids that, which is safer. However, the original text does mention cancer patients, so ""centro terapéutico"" is accurate. 

No incorrect information is present. The response aligns well with the original text. Therefore, it should get a score of 5 for being completely factual and consistent.

(Feedback for consistency) The response is too brief and lacks essential details about the event, such as the number of protests, the organization (Avante LGTBI+), the victim's age and background, and the locations. It fails to capture the key elements of the source text and omits significant factual information, which results in an incomplete and inaccurate summary. [RESULT] 2

[INST] Alright, let me try to work through this step by step. So, the task is to evaluate a response based on a rubric, and then provide feedback and a score. The user provided an example where the response was very brief, and the feedback was given as a 2 because it missed important details. Now, I need to think about how to approach a similar evaluation.

First, I need to understand the rubric. The rubric here is about ""Consistency"" – whether the summary aligns with the source text and doesn't hallucinate information. The score ranges from 1 to 5, with 5 being completely factual. The example response was given a 2 because it omitted key details like the number of protests, the organization, the victim's age, and the locations. 

Now, applying this to the current case. Let me imagine a new scenario. Suppose the instruction is to summarize a text about a protest, and the response is too short, missing crucial details. The reference answer would have all the important points. The rubric checks if the summary includes all necessary facts without adding false information.

So, for the evaluation, I need to check if the response includes all the key points from the source text. If it misses major elements, like the number of protests, the organization, the victim's details, or the locations, then it's inconsistent. The score would be lower. If the response adds information not present in the source, that's a hallucination, which also reduces the score.

In the example, the response was ""A denúncia do asasinato de Samuel Luiz."" This is just a statement, not a summary. It doesn't mention the number of protests, the organization, the victim's age, or the locations. Therefore, it's missing all the key points, leading to a score of 2. 

So, the feedback should point out that the response is too brief, lacks essential details, and fails to capture the key elements. The score would be 2 because it's missing most of the important information. 

I need to ensure that the feedback directly references the rubric criteria. In this case, consistency is about factual alignment. The response didn't include enough factual information, so it's penalized. The key elements from the reference answer are missing, hence the lower score.

I should also make sure not to add any extra information beyond the rubric. The feedback must strictly evaluate based on the provided criteria, not general opinions. The example shows that the response was considered too brief, so the feedback must highlight that brevity and lack of detail. 

Therefore, the process is: check against the rubric, identify missing elements, explain how the response fails to meet the criteria, and assign the appropriate score. In this case, the response is too short and lacks essential information, leading to a score of 2.

llama3-base," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—whether the summary aligns factually with the original text without hallucinations.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The response to evaluate is just a list of keywords like ""Estados Unidos, Biden, Trump, eleccións, presidente..."" It doesn't form a coherent summary. The reference answer, on the other hand, provides a structured summary that captures the main points: uncertainty about the president, Biden's lead, key states like Michigan and Wisconsin, the vote counts, and Trump's legal challenges.

Looking at the rubric, a score of 1 means the summary has no ideas from the original text. The response here is purely a list of keywords, which doesn't convey any meaningful summary. It doesn't explain the situation, the outcomes, or the context. There's no mention of the key states, the vote counts, or the legal challenges. It's just a list, so it's not even attempting to summarize the content. Therefore, it fails to meet the basic requirement of including factual information from the original text. 

The reference answer, which scores 5, includes all the essential details without adding any incorrect information. The response to evaluate doesn't even come close to that. Since it's just a list and lacks any coherent summary, it would receive the lowest score. 

So, the feedback should highlight that the response doesn't provide a summary but just lists keywords, leading to a score of 1.

The response to evaluate consists of a list of keywords rather than a coherent summary, failing to convey any meaningful information about the election results, key states, vote counts, or legal challenges mentioned in the original text.

Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to check the consistency of the response compared to the reference answer and the original text. The rubric is pretty strict, so I need to be careful.

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer gets a 5, so it's supposed to be fully factual. Let me check the key points mentioned in the original text and see if the response includes them accurately.

The original text talks about the Consellaría being criticized by the education community, the reduction of 109 units and 150 teachers, the CIG's accusation of ""jogar"" with numbers, the education being seen as a cost rather than investment, and the call for more efforts and possible actions in September. Also, the Consellaría's defense about more units than before the pandemic.

Looking at the response to evaluate: It mentions the criticism, the reduction of 109 units and 150 teachers, the CIG's accusation of ""jogar"" with numbers to deceive the public, the education as a cost, the call for more efforts, and the study of actions in September. The Consellaría's defense about more units is also included. 

Now, checking for hallucinations. The response doesn't add any information not present in the original text. It uses phrases like ""jogar"" correctly, mentions the numbers accurately, and includes the CIG's points about negotiation and dialogue. The reference answer also covers these points without adding anything extra. 

I don't see any incorrect information. All the key points are there, and the response doesn't introduce any new facts. The structure matches the reference answer, which is also a 5. So, according to the rubric, this should be a 5 because it's completely factual and aligns with the source.

However, it omits key details such as her breaking her personal record, the specific competition context (e.g., her sixth and final jump), and the athletes she surpassed (Rickets, Yulimar Rojas, and Patricia Mamona).

(Consistency) The response accurately states that Ana Peleteiro won a bronze medal in the women's triple jump and marks the first Olympic medal for Galician athletics, which are both correct facts from the source. However, it omits important details such as her breaking her personal record, the specific context of her sixth and final jump, and the athletes she surpassed (Rickets, Yulimar Rojas, and Patricia Mamona). While these omissions do not constitute hallucinations, they reduce the factual completeness of the summary. [RESULT] 4",4.0
llama3-5w1h,Failed to generate feedback,
llama3-5w1h," [INST]Okay, I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric. Let's start by understanding the task. The user wants a summary using the 5W1H method. The reference answer gets a score of 5, so I need to compare the response to that.

First, I'll check the response's adherence to the 5W1H. The response includes ""Que,"" ""Quen,"" ""Cando,"" ""Onde,"" ""Por que,"" and ""Como,"" which cover all the required elements. That's good. 

Now, looking at the rubric: Consistency with the source. The response mentions ""36 detidos"" and ""operación Neptuno,"" which are correct. However, it doesn't mention the key details like the victim's name, Jimmy, the specific date (30 de novembro), the location of the attack (Río Manzanares), or the political controversy. Also, it omits the part about the investigation into whether the attack was premeditated, the involvement of security forces, and the subsequent police actions. These are important points from the reference answer. 

Wait, the response does mention ""asasinato dun afeccionado do Deportivo"" and the date, but not the full name. The reference answer includes the name Jimmy, which the response doesn't. Also, the reference answer talks about the police's failure in security and the political fallout, which the response misses. 

The response seems to have omitted some critical information from the source text. But is there any hallucination? The response doesn't add any new facts not present in the original text. It just condenses the information. However, by omitting key details, it might be considered incomplete rather than hallucinated. 

The rubric says to penalize if the summary contains information not found in the original. The response doesn't have any such info, so consistency is okay. But the reference answer includes more detailed elements. The response might have missed some key points, but since it's not making up facts, it might still be a 4. Wait, the rubric says Score 5 is completely factual. If the response is missing some info but not hallucinating, maybe it's a 4. But the rubric's Score 4 is once incorrect piece. Wait, the rubric's Score 4 says ""contains once incorrect piece."" But in this case, the response is not incorrect, just incomplete. So perhaps the score is 5? Or is the incompleteness considered as missing information, which isn't penalized? The rubric says to penalize if it contains hallucinated facts, not if it's incomplete. Therefore, the response is factually correct but lacks some details. However, the reference answer includes more details. Wait, the rubric is about factual alignment, not completeness. So as long as the information presented is accurate, it's acceptable. The response doesn't have any hallucinations, so it's consistent. Therefore, it should get a 5. Wait, but the reference answer includes more details. Maybe the response is missing some key points but isn't wrong. So according to the rubric, if the summary is completely factual, even if it's less detailed, it's a 5. So the response is factually correct, so it's a 5. But maybe the user expects that missing key elements from the reference answer would lower the score. Wait, the rubric doesn't mention missing information, only hallucination. Therefore, the response is correct and should get a 5. However, the user's reference answer is more comprehensive. But the evaluation is based on the rubric, not on how comprehensive it is. Therefore, the answer is 5. But I'm confused because the response didn't mention the victim's name or the specific details about the police's failure, but those aren't hallucinations. So the answer should be 5. But I'm not sure. Wait, the rubric says if the summary contains information not found in the original, penalize. The response doesn't do that. So it's 5. But the user's response might be missing some elements, but since they are not hallucinated, it's okay. Therefore, the answer is 5.
[/INST]

The feedback for consistency: The response accurately reflects the factual information from the source text without introducing hallucinated details. It correctly identifies the key elements of the 5W1H framework, such as the who, what, when, where, why, and how, while aligning with the source document. However, it omits certain critical details like the victim’s name (Jimmy), the specific location of the attack (Río Manzanares), and the political controversy surrounding the incident. These omissions do not constitute factual inaccuracies but reflect a less comprehensive summary compared to the reference answer. Since no hallucinated information is present, the summary remains factually consistent. [RESULT] 5",5.0

Okay, let's start by looking at the task. The user wants me to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—ensuring the summary doesn't hallucinate or include incorrect information.

First, I need to compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer scores a 5, meaning it's completely factual. The response to evaluate is: ""A redución da fenda dixital en Galicia está sendo motivada polo aumento do uso de Internet e a dispoñibilidade de equipamentos nas casas, aínda que segue sendo menor que a media española. A redución da fenda dixital en Galicia está sendo motivada polo aumento do uso de Internet e a dispoñibilidade de equipamentos nas casas, aínda que segue sendo menor que a media española."" 

Wait, the response seems repetitive. It repeats the same sentence twice. That's odd. But the main point is whether the information is accurate. Let me check the original text. The original mentions that Galicia is reducing the digital divide but still lags behind Spain's average. The response correctly states that the reduction is due to increased internet use and availability of equipment, which aligns with the original text. However, the repetition might be a mistake, but it's not a hallucination. The key points are there, and they match the source. 

Now, checking the rubric: Score 1 is when there are no ideas from the original. Score 5 is completely factual. The response doesn't add any incorrect info. The reference answer includes more details like the factors (habitat, age), specific percentages, and mentions online purchases. The response to evaluate is more concise but misses those details. However, the rubric's main focus is on consistency, not completeness. Since the response doesn't hallucinate and sticks to the original content, even though it's brief, it's still consistent. Therefore, it should get a 5. But wait, maybe the repetition is a problem. However, the rubric doesn't mention redundancy as an issue. The main concern is factual accuracy, not repetition. So the score is 5.
[/INST]
The response accurately captures the key point about the reduction in the digital divide in Galicia being driven by increased internet use and equipment availability, while acknowledging the lag behind Spain's average. It aligns with the source without introducing hallucinations or inconsistencies. [RESULT] 5 [RESULT] 5 [RESULT] 5 [RESULT] 5 [RESULT] 5",5.0
llama3-5w1h," [INST]Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to summarize the given text using the 5W1H method. The response to evaluate needs to be checked against the reference answer which scored 5. The rubric is about consistency—whether the summary includes only facts from the source and doesn't hallucinate.

First, I'll break down the response. The user's answer covers Where (Lugo and Ourense), Who (Jesús Vázquez), When (past Thursday), Why (to stop rural depopulation and introduce economic measures), How (presenting 20 measures including economic promotion, job creation, etc.), and What (the Galicia Baleira platform with its initiatives). 

Now, checking against the reference answer. The reference mentions the platform was presented in Lugo, the organizations involved (Federación de Asociacións de Veciños de Lugo and Ourense), the 23 proposals, the focus on eastern provinces, the presentation to political groups, specific measures like improving infrastructure, internet, and the mention of Teruel Existe. It also notes the president's stance on not entering politics and the importance of future generations staying in rural areas.

Comparing the two, the evaluated response misses some key points. For instance, it doesn't mention the 23 proposals but refers to 20, which is a discrepancy. It also doesn't include the part about the eastern provinces being more affected, the connection to Teruel Existe, or the mention of political groups. The response is concise but lacks some critical details present in the reference. However, it doesn't add any hallucinated information. The main issue is the omission of certain factual elements, which according to the rubric would lower the score. The response is factually accurate but incomplete, leading to a score of 4. The rubric states that a score of 4 has one incorrect piece of information. Here, the incorrect part is the number of proposals (20 vs. 23), which is a factual inconsistency. Therefore, the score should be 4.
[/INST]

The response correctly identifies the key elements of the 5W1H framework, including the location (Lugo and Ourense), the key figure (Jesús Vázquez), the timeframe (past Thursday), the purpose (addressing rural depopulation and introducing economic measures), and the method (proposing 20 measures). However, it omits critical details present in the source, such as the 23 proposals, the focus on eastern provinces, the connection to Teruel Existe, and specific measures like infrastructure improvements and internet access. While the summary avoids hallucination, it fails to fully capture the depth of the initiative’s objectives and context. [RESULT] 4",4.0

Okay, let me start by understanding the task. The user wants me to evaluate a response based on the given rubric and provide feedback and a score. The rubric is about consistency, checking if the summary contains hallucinated facts or incorrect information.

First, I need to compare the response to evaluate with the reference answer. The reference answer is scored 5, meaning it's completely factual. The response to evaluate uses the 5W1H method, which is what the instruction asked for.

Looking at the response, it covers all the required elements: What, Who, When, Where, Why, How. Let me check each part against the original text. 

What: The response says the Consellaría is being criticized. The original text mentions criticism from the educational community, so that's accurate.

Who: It mentions CIG as the union that denounced the situation. The original text says CIG denounced it in a public statement. Correct.

When: The response states the next course 2021-2022. The original text mentions this date as well. Good.

Where: Galiza, Spain. The original text is about Galiza, so that's accurate.

Why: The reduction of units and staff affecting around 150 teachers. The original text states this, so correct.

How: The modification of the catalog leading to 109 units and 150 fewer teachers. The original text mentions this. 

Now, checking for any hallucinations. The response doesn't add any information not present in the original text. All the details are correctly represented. The answer stays within the facts provided. There's no incorrect information or made-up details. Therefore, the response aligns perfectly with the source, making it a score of 5. The feedback should note that the summary is factually consistent with the source, covering all aspects without hallucinations.
[/INST]
The response accurately captures all elements of the 5W1H method without introducing any hallucinated or incorrect information. Each section (What, Who, When, Where, Why, How) is factually aligned with the original text, reflecting precise details such as the specific reduction numbers, the role of CIG, and the timeline. [RESULT] 5",5.0
llama3-5w1h," (Consistency) The response correctly identifies the key factual elements from the text, such as the individuals involved, the time, place, and the nature of the incident.

Despite this, the core facts about the event itself are accurately represented without any hallucinations. [RESULT] 4

[/INST]
Okay, let's tackle this evaluation. The task is to assess the response using the Consistency rubric. First, I need to recall the rubric's criteria: the summary must align factually with the source, without hallucinations. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's completely factual.

Looking at the response to evaluate, it covers the 5W1H points. Let me check each part. 

Who: Javier M. and Montse López. The text mentions Javier M. as the attacker and Montse as his partner. The response includes both, which is correct.

What: A case of gender-based violence. The text describes the attack, so that's accurate.

When: May 15th at 9 AM. The text starts with ""esta mañana de miércoles 15 de mayo"" and specifies 9:00h. The response has that right.

Where: In front of the Union Agrarias office in Vimianzo. The text says ""diante da oficina de Unións Agrarias,"" which matches.

Why: Javier attacked his partner. The text states he did so, so that's correct.

How: He approached the office, she came out, he stabbed her. The text details the attack, so the response is accurate here.

Now, checking for any inconsistencies or hallucinations. The response doesn't add any information not present in the original text. It mentions the attack details, the victims, and the time and place correctly. However, the reference answer includes more context about the community responses, political context, and other events. But the rubric's consistency score is about factual alignment, not completeness. Since the response doesn't hallucinate and sticks to the facts, even if it misses some secondary details, it should still be a 5. Wait, but the initial feedback said 4 because it omitted some details. But according to the rubric, if there's no hallucination, it's a 5. The user's first feedback gave 4, but the second corrected it to 5. So, the correct answer here would be 5 because there's no incorrect info, just missing some context. The rubric doesn't penalize for missing context unless it's hallucinated. Therefore, the response is factually consistent, so a 5.

It includes the correct sequence of events leading to the aggression. However, it omits critical details about the broader context of the campaign, the legal implications, and the victim's subsequent legal considerations, which are present in the reference answer.

Okay, let me start by understanding the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the given rubric, which focuses on consistency—whether the summary aligns with the source text without hallucinations. 

First, I'll compare the response to the reference answer. The reference answer includes more details like the location of the macrocenter, the legal battle, the community opposition, and the broader impact on other women. The response provided only part of the information, missing these elements. However, the core facts about Irene, the date, location, and the reason for the aggression are correctly stated. 

Looking at the rubric, a score of 5 means the summary is completely factual. Since the response omits some key details but doesn't add false information, it's not hallucinating. However, it's missing important context, which might lower the score. The rubric mentions penalizing hallucinations, but not for omissions. So, even though the response is incomplete, as long as it doesn't include incorrect info, it can still get a higher score. 

The response includes the correct sequence of events, like Irene not signing, being physically attacked, and the police involvement. It doesn't mention the campaign's legal aspects or the community's stance, but those are not in the response. Since the rubric doesn't penalize for missing information, only for incorrect facts, the response is consistent. Therefore, the score should be 4 because it's factual but lacks some details. The reference answer has more comprehensive info, but the response doesn't fabricate anything. Hence, the feedback points out the omissions but confirms factual accuracy, leading to a 4.

Okay, let's take a look at this. The task is to evaluate the response based on the consistency rubric. The reference answer scores a 5 because it's completely factual. The response to evaluate mentions the association's request for a location from the council, the therapeutic center, and the improvements at the Hospital de Cee. 

First, I need to check if all these points are present in the original text. The original text talks about the association demanding the council's location for a therapeutic center and requesting more resources at the Hospital de Cee, like a 24-hour ICU or more specialties. The response includes these elements without adding extra info. 

The reference answer also mentions the lack of sufficient healthcare services in the area, referencing population density and distance to the main hospital. The response doesn't mention this, but since the rubric focuses on factual alignment, omitting some details isn't a penalty unless it's incorrect. The response doesn't hallucinate; it just condenses the main points. 

So, the response is factually consistent. No incorrect info, so it should get a 5. The feedback already states that, so the result is 5.

(Consistency) The response is factually inconsistent with the original text as it omits crucial details such as the 23 proposed measures, the specific involvement of Jesús Vázquez and Manuel Mosquera, the goals of preventing depopulation and promoting rural life, and the call for political action and collaboration with entities like Teruel Existe. It also lacks mention of key issues like improving internet access, transportation, and public services, which are significant aspects of the initiative described in the original text. [RESULT] 2
[/INST] [/INST] [INST] Okay, let me start by looking at the task. I need to evaluate the response based on the consistency rubric. The reference answer gets a score of 5 because it's fully factual and includes all the key points from the original text. 

First, I'll compare the response to evaluate with the original instruction. The response mentions that Galicia Baleira was presented in Lugo and is driven by the two federations. However, it's very brief and misses many important details. 

Looking at the reference answer, it includes specific numbers like the 23 proposals, the names of the leaders (Jesús Vázquez and Manuel Mosquera), the collaboration with Teruel Existe, the political actions planned, and the issues like internet access and public services. 

The response to evaluate doesn't mention these elements. For example, it doesn't talk about the 23 measures, the leadership structure, the collaboration with other groups, or the specific problems addressed like transportation and internet. It also doesn't mention the call for political action or the mention of Teruel Existe. 

Since the response omits multiple key points and doesn't fully align with the original text, it's inconsistent. According to the rubric, if there are several incorrect omissions, that would fall under a lower score. The reference answer has no hallucinations, but the evaluated response lacks critical information. 

The score rubric says Score 2 is for a large amount of incorrect information. Here, the response is missing several important facts, so it's not just a few errors but multiple omissions. Therefore, the score should be 2.

[/INST] (The response only mentions the investigation by Mossos d'Esquadra and the target of the letter with bullets, but omits critical details such as the interception in Barcelona before reaching Madrid, the lack of sender information, the second package directed to Carmen Gámez, and Díaz Ayuso's reaction. These omissions result in an incomplete and less informative summary.) [RESULT] 2

(The response captures the main event of the investigation and the target but lacks significant details present in the original text, such as the interception location, the absence of a sender, the second package, and Díaz Ayuso's comments. This omission leads to a summary that is factually limited and less comprehensive.) [RESULT] 2",2.0
