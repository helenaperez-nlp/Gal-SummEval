highest.\n\nCriterion: Coherence: the collective quality of all sentences. We align this dimension with the DUC quality question (Dang, 2005) of structure and coherence whereby 'the summary should be well-structured and well-organized. \nThe summary should not just be a heap of related information, but should build from sentence to sentence to a coherent body of information about a topic.' \nTo clarify, if you were a language teacher, how would you grade the flow of ideas? Does the summary contain connectors to conect ideas? It doesn't matter if there are grammatical errors or incorrect information. \nIf the summary is simply a list of events, we penalize it. We do not penalize single sentences for not having connectors.\n\nScore 1: The summary contains a bulletpoint list of events and there is no internal consistency (e.g., random words).\nScore 2: The summary contains a bulletpoint list of events, but there is no consistency between the phrases in each bulletpoint (e.g., 1. Keyboard, 2. Watching TV).\nScore 3: The summary contains a bulletpoint list of events, pero the phrases in each bullet point are developed well.\nScore 4: The summary contains implicit coherence, but not explicit. That means that there are no temporal connectors or discourse markers, but the sentences have a temporal/causal flow.\nScore 5: The summary contains explicit coherence via textual resources such as temporal connector or discourse markers that mark the relationship between ideas and sentences. \n\nProvide only the score for the criterion indicated below in the exact format. **Do not add any justification, explanation, or additional text**, just the score.\n\nExpected output format:\n- [COHERENCE]: score\n\n[SUMMARY] This is the summary to evaluate:\n{summary}\n\nProvide your evaluation
